It included two programs to assist businesses with\nkeeping workers employed: the\nPayroll Protection Program (PPP)\nadministered by\nthe\nSmall\nBusiness Adminstration\nand\nEmployee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC)\nadministered by the\nInternal Revenue Service.\nPPP funds are distributed based on 2.5 months of payroll and a minimum of 80% of the\nfunds must be used on payroll to be eligible for forgiveness. Additionally, PPP funds\nare not taxable as revenue and you may still take deductions for the payroll covered by\nPPP.\nERTC tax credits, however, are credits (or refunds) for a percentage of payroll in each\nquarter that you qualify. There are specific rules for determining eligibility by\nquarter, and limiting the dollars that can be claimed for each employee.\nERC eligibility requirements\nEmployer eligibility is largely determined by one of two key factors, at least one of\nwhich must apply in the calendar quarter the employer wishes to utilize the credit: Full\nor partial closure due to a government order. A business is eligible for the ERC if they\nwere forced to fully or partially suspend operations (FPSO) or reduce business because\nof a government COVID-19 order. Credit applies only for the part of the quarter the\nbusiness is suspended, not the entire quarter. There are certain businesses that\ngenerally do not meet this description and would not qualify:\nThose considered essential, unless they have supply of critical material or goods\ndisrupted in a manner that affects their ability to continue to operate. Businesses\nshuttered but continuing their operations largely as normal (telework). A significant\ndecline in gross receipts\nFor tax year 2020, the business must have seen a 50 percent drop in gross receipts when\ncomparing a quarter in 2020 with the corresponding quarter in 2019.Beginning in 2021,\nbusinesses must have seen more than a 20 percent drop in gross receipts in Q1 and Q2\ncompared to the same quarter in 2019. A new business is allowed to use gross receipts\nfor the quarter in which it started business as a reference for any quarter in which it\ndid not have 2019 figures.\nWhat are “qualified wages” and how to claim credits?\nQualified wages are compensation paid by an employer to some or all FTE’s in the relevant\nquarter. Qualified wages include the employer’s qualified health plan expenses that are\nallocable to the wages.The ERC is applied to employer’s contribution to Social Security\n& Medicare taxes and is fully refundable. In order to claim ERC, you must calculate\ntotal qualified wages and the related health insurance costs for each quarter, and\nretroactively claim the credit through Form 941-X.\nThe Million Dollar Question is . . . Do They Have The Time?\nDo they have the time to dig into the text of American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nAnd its accompanying referenced laws like:\nCARES Act, Families First Act, Payroll\n&\nHealthcare Enhancement Act, PPP Payroll Flexibility Act\nand the\nConsolidated\nAppropriations Act.\nTime to read the\nIRS Interpretations and FAQ’s\n? And cross-reference those\ndefinitions with that of PPP which was separately defined and dissimilarly\ninterpreted in the\nSmall Business Administration’s Bulletins and IFRs?\nDo they have the time to ensure accuracy in eligibility determination, maximize your\ncomputation and create the supporting documentation you’ll need to support an IRS\naudit of employer taxes?\nSo far, we have not found a bookkeeper who is able to take all this on, while handling\nthe day-to-day of bookkeeping. If yours can, then take them up on their offer. We’re\nhappy to take a second look.\nHow does the number of employees factor into the ERC?\nThe rules are different depending on how many employees you have. The updated 2021\nprogram bumped these categories up from 100 full-time employees (FTE’s) in 2019 to 500\nFTE’s in 2019. Employers with 500 or fewer FTE’s in 2019 can apply the ERC towards all\nqualified wages paid to employees during those quarters, whether or not employees were\nworking at the time. Employers with more than 500 full-time employees can apply the ERC\ntowards qualified wages paid to employees who were not working during a quarter because\nthe business suspended operations or had a significant decline in gross receipts. These\nemployers can only count wages up to the amount that the employee would have been paid\nfor working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the period\nof economic hardship.\nI got PPP funds already. Can I also get ERTC?\nInitially with the\nCARES Act,\nemployers could choose to apply for PPP or claim\nERTC credits, but not both.\nPPP was more beneficial than ERTC for most businesses (for reasons we won’t go into here)\nand so most businesses with under 500 employees received forgivable PPP Loans.\nOn March 11, 2021,\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nwas signed into law and\nincluded many modifications and expansions to existing elements of previous stimulus\nprograms.\nNoteworthy modifications for business owners included:\nBusinesses who applied for and received PPP funds could now also claim ERTC\ncredits.\nERTC credits could be\nretroactively claimed\nfor businesses that qualified in\n2020.\nERTC credits were extended through 9/30/21 with lower qualification requirements.\nThe per-employee cap on qualifying wages increased from $10,000 for all of 2020 to\n$10,000 per quarter for the first 3 quarters of 2021.\nThe refundable credit amount increased from 50% of qualifying wages in 2020 to 70%\nin 2021.\nSo the short answer is\n“Yes”\n. . . you can claim ERTC even if you received PPP\nfunds.\nHow do I apply for ERTC tax credits?\nUnlike the\nPayroll Protection Program\n(administered by the Small Business\nAdministration), there is actually no “application process” for the\nEmployee\nRetention Tax Credits.\nYou simply claim the ERTC tax credit like you would any other tax credit – by asserting\nto the IRS that you can legally claim the credit.\nWhen you claim a child tax credit, you do so by asserting this fact on your Form 1020\nPersonal Income Tax Return.\nThe difference is that when you claim an ERTC tax credit, you do so on your Form 941\nEmployer Quarterly Tax Filing.\nFor prior quarters, you must file an amended form (the Form 941-X) to reduce your current\nquarter’s tax contribution and request a refund of excess credits (which is highly\nlikely).\nAnother perk of ERTC, is that since you can often estimate these credits in advance of\ndistributing cash for payroll, you can file a Form 7200 to receive a cash advance to\navoid waiting until the end of the quarter to apply for the refund.\nMy revenue in Q1 2021 is back to pre-pandemic levels - so I must be ineligible - right?\nEven though you may feel like revenue is back to normal, there are some items you want to\nconsider before passing on this ERTC assessment.\nFirst, even if revenues have returned to “normal” in 2021, you\nmay have qualified in\n2020 and you can retroactively claim those credits.\nThat eligibility criteria in\n2020 was based on revenue declines from 2019, or if your business was partially or fully\nclosed due to governmental mandate.\nSecond, while your revenue may have returned to “normal” in Q1 2021, remember that\nwe\nare comparing your Q1 2021 to Q1 2019.\nIf 2019 was a year of growth for your\nbusiness, then your revenue levels 2 years ago may have been much less than Q1 2020.\nAnd lastly, if your revenues were down in\nQ4 2020 by just 20% compared to Q4 2019,\nthen you may also be eligible for Q1 2021. There is a safe harbor provision that few\nadvisors are talking about, and it means that many businesses are qualifying for $7,000\nper employee in Q1 2021.\nI know, it seems too good to be true, but the government wants to incentivize and reward\nyou for keeping US residents employed and money flowing through our economy as we\nrebuild bigger and stronger than before.\nI thought payroll taxes deferred in 2020 had to be re-paid. Does ERTC work the same way?\nYou are most likely referring to a provision of the\nCARES Act\nthat allowed\nemployers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer’s share of Social Security\ntaxes. Those deferrals must then be repaid – with at least 50% of the balance due by\n12/31/21 and the remaining balance due by 12/31/22.\nERTC credits are\nNOT\na deferral. They are dollar-for-dollar credits against wages\nyou’ve paid. Not taxes you’ve paid, but actual wages.\nThese credits can offset future tax contributions or you can receive a refund check –\nit’s your choice.\nAnd you will\nNOT\nhave to re-pay these funds (unless, of course, you don’t provide\nadequate documentation in the course of an audit).\nWhy isn't my bank talking about this?\nYour banker was probably very helpful when it came to getting your PPP funds because they\nwere effectively signing you to an SBA-guaranteed loan. The SBA paid the bank\nadministrative fees based on the PPP loans they made, and so they were incentivized to\neducate you about the program and get all your paperwork in order.\nCompared to the ERTC, the PPP program was also a rather simple calculation. 2 ½ times\nyour average monthly payroll including health insurance and state unemployment taxes.\nFrom the conversations we’ve had with bankers, they have no interest in involving\nthemselves in your employment tax compliance. For them it is a liability and beyond\ntheir scope of services.\nWill my Tax CPA handle this for me since they handle my income tax returns?\nWhether your tax accountant is a CPA or EA, he or she most likely only prepares your\nFederal and State Income Tax Returns. However, ERTC credits are claimed against\nEmployment Taxes on Form 941, and cash advanced through Form 7200.\nThe complexity of the ERTC program is a beast unto itself and every tax accountant we’ve\ntalked to has said they focus on staying up-to-date on the ever-evolving income tax\ncode, and they can’t now become experts in the ERTC program as well.\nIf your tax accountant is comfortable determining your eligibility by quarter and year,\ncomputing your credits, and preparing contemporaneous documentation to support an IRS\naudit, then you should certainly let them handle all of this.\nIf you want a second set of eyes on this, we’re happy to take a look.\nWhat about my Payroll Service Provider? Shouldn't they be on top of this?\nYour Payroll Service does an excellent job of executing the fundamentals of paying your\nemployees, paying your employment taxes and filing your quarterly reports.\nBut computing your ERTC credits requires visibility into your P&L and PPP forgiveness\napplications. Not only that, but the complex requirements around eligibility and\nallocating ERTC credits at the employee-level while accounting for annual and quarterly\nqualifying wage gaps and . . . well, you can probably tell why Payroll Services are not\noffering to do all of this for you.\nThe Payroll Services that we’ve worked with so far are happy to provide the payroll\nregisters that we need to perform the allocations. And they are happy to file the\nAmended Form 941-X\nwith the IRS on our client’s behalf.\nBut that’s the extent of it.\nIn fact, most wise Payroll Services are asking clients to sign an indemnification waiver\nbefore submitting a Form 941-X because the Payroll Service can take no responsibility\nfor the accuracy of the ERTC credits you are claiming.\nFor them to involve themselves in the intricacies of this calculation, it is a liability\nand beyond their scope of services.\nWhy did the IRS issue a warning about 3rd party processing companies?\nThe IRS issued these warnings, as there are many fly-by-night, so-called ERC “experts” or\n“consultants” that are misrepresenting their experiences and the parameters of the ERC\nprogram to employers. The ERC is a complicated tax program that requires deep expertise\nand understand of the nuances. When choosing an ERC company look for companies with a\nproven real track record and watch out for red flags (e..g, large upfront cost, no CPAs\nor tax professionals on staff)\nHow long does the IRS have to audit my ERC?\n“The IRS Audit period for ERC is:\n3 years for 2020 and Q1,Q2 of 2021\n5 years for Q3 of 2021 “\nAre there any restrictions on how I can spend my ERC refund?\nUnlike a loan or other form of business funding, the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is a\nfully refundable tax credit that does not come with limitations on how it can be spent.\nAs a result, businesses that qualify for the ERC can choose to spend their refund in any\nway they see fit.\nBrowse All\nFAQ's\nFREE LANDING INSIGHTS ON EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT\nSubmit",

NO\nR&D tax credits are available to all organizations that engage in certain activities. Opportunities\nalso exist in industries that are not known for conducting R&D activities like Software development,\nAgriculture, Architecture, Construction, and Engineering, Restaurants, Retail.\nIf you are conducting qualified research and development projects, it is beneficial to claim the R&D\ntax credit regardless of your company’s taxable income. R&D tax credits can be carried forward to\noffset future income tax liability. Typically, credits that cannot be used immediately will carry\nforward for up to 20 years. Also, companies can often claim the R&D tax credit retroactively by\nfiling amended returns.\nExamples of R&D activities include but are not limited to the following:\nDeveloping or engineering a new or improved product, process, formula, or software\nEvaluating the feasibility of a product, process, formula, or software\nDeveloping engineering architecture\nDeveloping experimental models & prototypes\nTesting an experimental product, process,formula, or software\nBeta testing\nImproving processes or the manufacturability of a product\nTechnical design reviews\nParticipating in technical meetings\nDocumenting the results of research\nMaintaining research equipment\nCompiling research data\nFabricating experimental models\nExperimenting with innovative technologies\nCreating more efficient and environmentally\nfriendly designs\nSupervising technical personnel engaged in R&D\nR&D Tax Credit Criteria\nQualified Purpose\nTo develop a new or improved business component including product, process, software, technique,\ninvention, or formula to enhance functionality, performance, reliability, or quality.\nTechnological in nature\nThe business component’s development must be based on a hard science, such as computer science,\nengineering, biological sciences, or the physical sciences, including testing, developing\nmodels, software, patents, or prototypes.\nTechnical Uncertainty\nFrom the outset, the organization must have faced technological technical uncertainty when\ndesigning or developing the business component. For example, this technical uncertainty can be\nrelated to the capability or methodology of the development or improvement, or the\nappropriateness of the design.\nProcess of experimentation\nThe company must have evaluated multiple design alternatives or employed a systematic trial and\nerror approach to overcome the technological uncertainties.\nBOOK\nA Free Consultation\nBook a no-obligation\n15-minute consult and\njoin\nthousands of\nother business\nthat we are helping qualify for the program\nDocumentation\nClaiming the R&D tax credit could become easier by maintaining proper documentation.\nLearn what\ndocuments you will need to get the claim.\nPayroll information and timesheets for employees directly involved in R&D and for employees or\nmanagers supervising them\nGeneral ledger reports listing which business expenses and supplies were related to R&D\nCopies of contracts and invoices paid to any contractors who do third-party research for you\nTimekeeping records for work plans, payroll, meetings, and any other activities to prove they\nwere related to R&D\nDesign drawings, test records, blueprints, progress reports, marketing materials and any other\ndocumentation that shows the process and impact of your research\nFostering America Innovation & Job Creation\nWhite paper for 2024 on Research & Development Tax Credit.\nDownload\nfor FREE\nFostering America Innovation & Job Creation\nWhite paper for 2024 on Research & Development Tax Credit.\nDownload\nfor FREE\n– FAQ’s\nWhat is the R&D tax credit?\nEstablished in 1981, this incentive rewards US-businesses for investing in research and\ndevelopment (R&D) activities. This incentive lowers the income tax liability for businesses\nthat develop new or improve existing products, processes, software, or formulas.\nHow do I know if I qualify?\nThe definition of qualified activities is pretty broad. Because of this, there is no cookie\ncutter industry or company profile that determines eligibility. If you have developed a\nproduct, process, software, or formula that relies on either physical, biological,\nengineering, or computer science, it’s very likely you qualify.\nHow much is it worth?\nThe credit is generally worth 10% of your qualified expenditures such as wages, contractors,\nhosting and infrastructure, and supplies.\nHow do I use this credit?\nThe R&D tax credit is designed to lower a company’s tax liability. For established\nbusinesses, it is used as a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction of your income tax liability.\nIf you’re a startup, you may have the option to use this credit against the employer’s\nportion of social security taxes up to $250,000 per year. To be eligible as a qualified\nstartup, you must be within your first five years of gross receipt, and be under $5 million\nin gross receipts for the tax year in consideration.\nI won’t have an income tax liability for this year. Is it still worth it to claim this\ncredit?\nYes! These credits have a 20 year carry forward period to be used against future income tax\nliabilities.\nHow do I claim this credit?\nYou claim this credit by filing an additional tax form along with your company’s annual tax\nfiling. Occams will prepare the necessary additional tax forms for you, and you will provide\nthem to your CPA to be filed alongside your annual filing.\nI’ve never claimed this credit before. Can I go back and claim for previous years?\nYou can amend previous tax returns to claim any unclaimed credits. Based on the statute of\nlimitations for amending previous returns, you can go back up to 3 years to claim the R&D\ncredit.\nIn doing so, you may potentially get a refund based on income taxes you paid in those years,\nor you can carry forward those credits to future years.\nI already have a CPA. Is this something they can do for me?\nGreat! We partner with hundreds of CPAs to help their clients claim these tax incentives. We\nfind this to be a bit of a specialty service – think of your CPA as a general practitioner,\nand Occams as a cardiologist.\nOccams does not file any forms on your behalf – we prepare all the necessary forms to be\nincluded with your annual filing. In this case, you would pass along our work to your CPA,\nand we’ll work with them as needed to make sure everything gets done accordingly.\nIs this a one-time thing?\nNo. This credit can be claimed for every year in which you incur R&D expenses. There is no\nlimit to the number of times you can claim this credit, and there is no cap on the amount.\nWhat is the process to claim the credit?\nThere are two important parts to an R&D tax credit study: substantiation and calculation. Our\nteam of experts will help you build the case for why you qualified for the R&D credit\n(substantiation), and work with you build the financial framework to calculate your credit.\nWe try to take on most of the heavy lifting so you don’t have to. The timeline varies from\ncompany to company, but traditionally a study takes about 3-4 weeks.\nWhat do I do if I get audited?\nAs long as your filing does not contain errors, you are guaranteed to receive a credit based\non the expenses you claimed. However, the IRS may request documentation to prove that your\nexpenses meet the criteria for qualified research. This is what we’re building during our\nprocess.\nWe make sure your R&D claim is bulletproof. Even if the IRS disagrees with the amount of your\ncredit, they won’t charge you penalties or interest, just the difference in calculation.\nFREE LANDING INSIGHTS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nSubmit",

It dictates how value is stored, transferred, and measured. Yet, beneath the surface, the structure of a monetary system defines its fragility or resilience. In today’s world, we operate under a fiat standard, where money is created through debt. But an alternative is emerging—a Bitcoin standard, where money is tied to energy and computation rather than credit expansion.\nFiat Standard: Debt = Money Supply\nUnder the modern fiat system, money does not exist independently—it is issued into existence through debt. When a central bank issues money or a commercial bank extends a loan, it simultaneously creates a liability. This means:\nTotal Money Supply ≈ Σ (Outstanding Debt)\nNew credit issuance expands the money supply. Debt repayment contracts the money supply. If debt creation halts, money disappears, leading to deflation.\nExample: The Debt-Expansion Feedback Loop\nImagine an economy where the government and private sector hold $10T in debt. If interest rates are 5%, the system requires $500B in new money just to pay the interest. This forces further borrowing:\nNew Debt = Old Debt + (Old Debt × Interest Rate)\nIf credit growth stalls, debt defaults start cascading, leading to a financial crisis. This is why fiat economies are inherently fragile—they require infinite expansion in a finite world from a resource standpoint.\nBitcoin Standard: Energy + Computation = Money Supply\nBitcoin is fundamentally different. Instead of money being issued as debt, Bitcoin is issued as a function of thermodynamic proof-of-work. It is backed by energy and computational work, making it a closed-loop monetary system.\nNew Bitcoin Supply = f(Energy Expended, Computational Difficulty)\nUnlike fiat money, which can be printed arbitrarily, Bitcoin’s issuance follows a predictable curve:\nTotal BTC ≤ 21,000,000\nThis makes Bitcoin structurally anti-inflationary. Rather than requiring infinite credit expansion, its security model is rooted in thermodynamics—real-world energy and computation.\nExplaining f in the Equation\nIn the equation:\nNew Bitcoin Supply = f(Energy Expended, Computational Difficulty),\nThe function f represents a complex algorithm that governs Bitcoin mining. It adjusts the mining reward based on:\n- The amount of computational work done (hash power used by miners).\n- The difficulty level, which is adjusted roughly every two weeks to maintain a steady block time of ~10 minutes.\nThis ensures that new Bitcoin is issued in a controlled and predictable manner, regardless of fluctuations in mining power.\nComparing the Two Systems Mathematically\nFiat vs Bitcoin at a glance\nThe Path Forward: Fragility vs. Resilience\nThe fiat system is fundamentally fragile because it requires constant credit expansion. Bitcoin, by contrast, is resilient because its monetary base is independent of debt dynamics and secured by physical energy. As Occams Advisory continues to explore Bitcoin’s role in financial architecture, one question remains:\nDo we want a system built on perpetual debt, or one anchored in immutable scarcity?\nThe answer to that question may define the FUTURE OF MONEY.\nFor more information about our services or to explore collaboration opportunities, we invite you to visit our website or contact our New Delhi office directly.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Gaining a Competitive Edge: Dominate, Don’t Just Compete\n▷\nStrategies to Supercharge Your Lead Generation\n▷\nThe Big Takeaway\nIntroduction\nIn the high-stakes world of financial and professional services, where relationships and trust dictate success, lead generation isn’t just a business function—it’s the engine that powers growth, revenue, and industry leadership. Yet, many businesses treat it as a box to check rather than the strategic imperative it truly is.\nAs a\nSenior B2B Lead Generation Specialist,\nI’ve seen how transformative a robust lead generation strategy can be. Done right, it’s not just about finding leads; it’s about building a dynamic ecosystem that attracts, engages, and converts the right prospects, time and time again.\nLet’s dive into why lead generation is the beating heart of B2B success and how it can redefine the growth trajectory of your business.\n1. Fueling the Sales Pipeline: From Chaos to Consistency\nPicture your sales team as a highly skilled crew aboard a ship—but without a steady stream of leads, they’re navigating aimlessly in open waters. Lead generation acts as the compass, charting the path to new opportunities.\nA Steady Stream of Leads:\nA well-oiled lead generation strategy ensures that your sales pipeline never runs dry. It creates momentum, turning sporadic wins into consistent victories.\nEmpowering Sales Teams:\nWith a predictable flow of qualified leads, sales professionals can focus on what they do best: closing deals and nurturing relationships, rather than scrambling to find prospects.\nWhy it matters:\nIn financial and professional services, where buying decisions are high-value and complex, consistency isn’t a luxury—it’s survival.\n2. Building Brand Awareness: Visibility Breeds Trust\nIn a world where expertise is currency, you can’t afford to be invisible. Effective lead generation doesn’t just find potential clients; it puts your brand on the map, amplifying your voice and authority in the marketplace.\nBe Seen, Be Trusted:\nA robust strategy increases your visibility where it matters most—whether it’s on LinkedIn, industry forums, or through thought-provoking webinars.\nEstablishing Thought Leadership:\nOffering valuable insights through whitepapers, blogs, and industry reports positions your brand as the trusted advisor prospects turn to when they need answers.\nExample:\nA financial advisory firm sharing actionable insights on navigating economic uncertainty isn’t just educating—it’s cultivating trust and making its name synonymous with reliability.\n3. Identifying Ideal Customers: Precision Over Guesswork\nNot every lead is created equal, and in B2B, chasing the wrong ones can be a costly mistake. Modern lead generation helps you zero in on your ideal customer profile with pinpoint accuracy.\nInsights That Matter:\nAdvanced tools and analytics help uncover who your ideal customers are, what they value, and where they engage.\nPersonalized Outreach:\nOnce you know your audience, tailored messaging and solutions make your business irresistible.\nWhy this works:\nIn professional services, personalization isn’t optional—it’s expected. High-value prospects respond to tailored outreach that speaks to their unique pain points.\n4. Measuring Marketing Effectiveness: Metrics That Drive Growth\nLead generation without measurement is like sailing without a map. Knowing what works—and what doesn’t—is critical to evolving and scaling your strategy.\nTrack What Matters:\nMetrics such as cost per lead, conversion rates, and lead quality scores provide a clear picture of performance.\nData-Driven Decisions:\nArmed with data, you can double down on high-performing strategies and cut the fat from underperforming campaigns.\nPro Tip:\nIn financial services, data isn’t just a tool; it’s your competitive advantage. Use it not only to optimize campaigns but to predict future trends and client behaviors.\n5. Fostering Long-Term Relationships: From Leads to Lifelong Clients\nLead generation is often seen as transactional—generate a lead, close the deal, move on. But in industries where relationships are king, that mindset is shortsighted.\nNurture to Win:\nBuilding trust with consistent, value-driven communication turns prospects into loyal clients.\nFrom Clients to Advocates:\nHappy clients become your biggest champions, bringing in referral leads and amplifying your reputation.\nReal Impact:\nImagine a law firm nurturing a lead with personalized updates about industry legislation. When the lead finally needs representation, guess who they’ll call?\n6. Gaining a Competitive Edge: Dominate, Don’t Just Compete\nIn B2B, it’s not enough to keep up—you need to stand out. A well-executed lead generation strategy doesn’t just keep you in the game; it positions you as the frontrunner.\nOutshine Competitors:\nBy delivering value before the competition even gets a foot in the door, you establish yourself as the obvious choice.\nMarket Share Growth:\nA consistent flow of quality leads translates directly to increased revenue, market share, and industry influence.\nThe Bottom Line:\nIn financial and professional services, trust is hard to win and easy to lose. Lead generation is your opportunity to make a strong first impression—and keep the momentum going.\nStrategies to Supercharge Your Lead Generation\nReady to transform your approach? Here are strategies that have delivered exceptional results in financial and professional services:\n1.\nContent Marketing:\nShare high-value insights through blogs, whitepapers, and webinars that address real-world challenges.\n2.\nSocial Media Marketing:\nLeverage LinkedIn and other platforms to engage directly with decision-makers and build your professional network.\n3.\nEmail Marketing:\nUse targeted campaigns to nurture leads with personalized, actionable content.\n4.\nPaid Advertising:\nPlatforms like LinkedIn Ads and Google Ads help you reach high-intent prospects with precision.\n5.\nPartnerships and Networking:\nCollaborate with influencers and industry organizations to expand your reach and credibility.\nThe Big Takeaway\nLead generation isn’t a one-and-done activity—it’s a living, breathing process that drives the growth of your sales pipeline, builds your brand’s authority, and keeps you ahead of the competition.\nAs a Senior B2B Lead Generation Specialist, I’ve seen how businesses in financial and professional services can flourish when they make lead generation a strategic priority. It’s not just about finding leads—it’s about forging connections, solving problems, and creating lasting value.\nWritten by\nBipin Singh, Lead – Digital Marketing, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Additionally, the 179D and 45L energy-efficient building incentives offer substantial benefits for companies aiming to improve their energy efficiency.\nUnderstanding Emerging Technologies\nAI encompasses machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing, offering transformative potential across various sectors. Companies leveraging AI in their R&D activities can benefit from significant advancements in automation, data analysis, and product development.\nBlockchain technology, known for its secure and transparent transaction capabilities, is revolutionizing industries such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Its applications in secure data sharing and smart contracts present new avenues for R&D.\nIoT involves interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data. This technology is pivotal in creating smart environments, from homes to factories, enabling real-time monitoring and optimization of systems.\n179D and 45L Energy Tax Credits\nThe 179D and 45L tax credits are crucial for businesses focusing on energy-efficient building projects. The 179D tax deduction provides benefits for commercial buildings that achieve specific energy efficiency standards, while the 45L tax credit applies to energy-efficient residential properties. These incentives complement traditional R&D tax credits by promoting sustainable innovation in building technologies.\nIdentifying Qualifying R&D Activities\nTo qualify for R&D tax credits, AI projects must demonstrate a clear advancement in the field, addressing scientific or technological uncertainties. Examples include developing new algorithms, enhancing machine learning models, or creating AI-driven applications that solve complex problems.\nR&D in blockchain may involve developing new protocols, enhancing security features, or creating innovative applications for decentralized systems. These activities must show a systematic approach to solving technical challenges and advancing the technology.\nQualifying IoT R&D activities often include designing new sensor technologies, improving data communication protocols, or developing advanced data analytics platforms. Projects should focus on overcoming technical obstacles and advancing the integration of IoT systems.\nEnergy-Efficient Building Projects\nQualifying activities under the 179D and 45L tax credits involve designing and implementing energy-efficient building technologies. This includes developing new HVAC systems, lighting solutions, or building envelope improvements that meet or exceed energy efficiency standards.\nWith the rapidly changing technology landscape, having a knowledgeable partner can make all the difference. Occams Advisory provides specialized expertise to ensure your projects meet the necessary criteria for R&D tax credits.\nDocumentation and Compliance\nAccurate and comprehensive documentation is crucial for substantiating R&D tax credit claims. Businesses should maintain detailed records of project objectives, methodologies, and outcomes, along with time tracking and expense reports.\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements\nAdhering to the latest regulations and guidelines is essential. Companies should stay informed about changes in R&D tax credit legislation and ensure their activities meet the criteria set forth by tax authorities. For energy-efficient projects, this includes ensuring compliance with the standards required for 179D and 45L tax credits.\nCase Studies: Early Adopters of Emerging Technology R&D\nAI in Healthcare\nA healthcare company developed an AI-based diagnostic tool that improves the accuracy and speed of disease detection. By systematically documenting their R&D process and demonstrating the tool’s advancement over existing technologies, they successfully claimed R&D tax credits, reducing their tax liability significantly.\nBlockchain in Supply Chain Management\nA logistics firm implemented a blockchain-based system to enhance transparency and security in their supply chain. The project involved developing new protocols and overcoming technical challenges, qualifying them for substantial R&D tax credits.\nIoT in Manufacturing.\nA manufacturing company integrated IoT sensors into their production lines to monitor equipment performance in real-time. The project required developing custom sensors and data analytics platforms, allowing them to claim R&D tax credits for their innovative efforts.\nEnergy-Efficient Building Projects\nA construction firm focused on developing energy-efficient residential properties qualified for the 45L tax credit by integrating advanced insulation and HVAC systems. Another company improved the energy efficiency of a commercial building, meeting the standards for the 179D tax deduction through innovative lighting and building envelope technologies.\nAdapting Documentation and Compliance for New Technologies\nLeveraging Technology for Record-Keeping\nEmerging technologies can also aid in maintaining compliance. Utilizing blockchain for secure documentation, AI for automated record-keeping, and IoT for real-time data collection can streamline the R&D tax credit claim process.\nAs governments adapt to the rapid pace of technological change, R&D tax credit regulations may evolve. Companies should establish processes to monitor legislative updates and adjust their R&D strategies accordingly. This includes staying informed about changes to the 179D and 45L energy tax credit requirements.\nOccams Advisory continuously monitors regulatory changes to provide clients with up-to-date advice, helping them stay compliant and maximize their R&D tax credit benefits.\nFuture Trends in R&D Tax Credits\nGovernments worldwide recognize the transformative potential of emerging technologies and are likely to enhance R&D tax credit schemes to support innovation in these areas.\nFuture R&D tax credits may place more emphasis on projects that contribute to sustainability and environmental goals, encouraging companies to develop green technologies. The 179D and 45L tax credits are prime examples of this trend, promoting energy efficiency in building projects.\nThe trend towards open innovation and collaboration across industries and borders may influence R&D tax credit policies, promoting joint ventures and knowledge sharing.\nConclusion\nThe future of R&D tax credits is intrinsically linked to the adoption and development of emerging technologies. By understanding the nuances of these technologies, meticulously documenting their R&D activities, and staying compliant with evolving regulations, businesses can maximize their tax credit benefits. As governments continue to recognize the importance of innovation, companies that adapt to these changes will be well-positioned to thrive in the future.\nFor expert guidance on maximizing your R&D tax credits, contact Occams Advisory.

That's down from the 180,000 that were shut down at the very onset of the pandemic. It actually reveals, though, a 23 percent rise in the number of closures since mid-July.\nYelp also takes into account companies whose openings have been permanent, in addition to tracking closed companies. Throughout the last six months, the figure has gradually risen, now reaching 97,966, reflecting 60 per cent of closing companies that will not reopen.\n\"Overall, data from Yelp indicates that company closures have continued to climb with a 34 percent spike in permanent closures since our last mid-July survey,\" said Justin Norman, Yelp's vice president of data science, to CNBC.\nYelp's September update marks six months since March 1, the day the organization calls the start of the market crisis.\nYelp tracks shifts in trading hours or explanations on its app to collect closing details, giving an instant, personalized view of the effects the pandemic has had on small businesses.\n\"We definitely took away the hard hit small enterprises, but we have seen that home, industrial, technical and automobile sectors have been more able to survive the impact of the pandemic than other sectors,\" Norman noted.\nThe evidence reflects the pattern that more people opt to sit at home over physically patronizing shops, when home and technical firms such as landscapers, architects, and attorneys experience a significantly lower closing rate than retail retailers and even home decor providers. A relatively low closing rate was also registered by auto and towing services.\n\"These programmes are still needed by customers,\" Norman said. \"Through the growth of remote consultations and contactless or socially distant facilities, these organizations have during this period proven especially resilient.\"\nThe constraints imposed by the pandemic have affected restaurants , bars and nightlife venues the most over the last six months: 32,109 restaurants have been suspended as of Aug. 31. At 61 thousand, the number of restaurants compelled to close indefinitely is marginally above Yelp 's cumulative level.\nYelp has also noted that firms such as pizza stores, coffee shops and delis, which are also well suited for takeout, are better at treading water than most restaurants. The categories of restaurants with the largest closures include breakfast and brunch locations, Mexican restaurants and sandwich shops.\nNorman noted that in the coming weeks and months, legislative changes may have an effect on whether these cuts would become permanent. \"The continued rollout of indoor dining, especially in metro stations such as New York City, will be worth watching as it will be crucial for companies to maintain the correct mix of social distance practises and other responsible security measures to ensure that they remain safe.\"\nBars and nightlife venues have saw a significant effect from the pandemic, with a company that can't transition with readily to eating or taking outside. While this is a market six times smaller than hotels, 6,451 locations have closed. After July, the number of permanent closures has risen by 10%, now sitting at 54%.\nRetail has seen a similar rise in permanent closures since July, increasing 10 per cent to a confirmed permanent total of 58 per cent. That's out of 30.374 shopping outlets closed.\nThe study shows a remarkable month-over - month spike in permanent closures for cosmetics firms. Since July, about 42 percent more firms have been listed as permanently closed. Complete beauty industry closures stand at 16,585, which is a rise of 22 percent since July.\nMultiple states are now experiencing different degrees of closures, and Yelp sees a link between states with a large number of closures and states with a high unemployment rate, perhaps unsurprisingly. Hawaii was struck the hardest, followed by California , Nevada, Arizona and Washington State, looking at closures per 1,000 for each state.In July, Hawaii's unemployment rate stood at 13 per cent, and the state depends heavily on tourism as well.\n\"These states have been significantly affected by travel bans because of the pandemic and still face high unemployment rates,\" Norman said. \"These states are also home to the most hard-hit metro stations like Las Vegas, Honolulu and some of California's major metropolitan centres such as San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles.\"\nYelp also noted differences between major cities, where closures are higher and businesses are not faring well, and smaller communities, which have proved more forgiving of small businesses.The largest number of closures has been recorded in Los Angeles and New York: Los Angeles has seen 15,000 closures, half of which are permanent, and New York has seen more than 11,000 closures, with a high 63 percent rate recorded as permanent.\n\"Meanwhile, with fewer closures in the East, like Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, we are also having greater metros,\" Norman noted.\nUltimately, Yelp's data reveals that Main Street is already suffering the pandemic's economic effect and certain business states and regions will not see a rebound in the near future.\n\"While it's hard to predict when we should expect market closures to recover, companies have managed to respond effectively to these challenging times over the past six months due to their own hard work, creativity, and shifts in local policy,\" Norman said.\n#Covid19 #OccamsAdvisory #Yelp #Pandemic #Economy #USA #EconomyReport #PandemicProof\nRelated Topic Blog\nA deep dive into the workings of a merchant account.\nThere's no sorting of credit cards themselves.

The credit works to lower a company’s Corporation Tax by 25% of the qualifying expenses (CT). A business may seek for a credit that is payable in instalments if its CT liabilities have been offset in both the current and prior years.\nA business might be eligible for the R&D Tax Credit if:\nIt falls under the jurisdiction of CT in Ireland\nif qualifying R&D activities are carried out in either Ireland or the European Economic Area (EEA) and\nIt falls under the jurisdiction of CT in Ireland if qualifying R&D activities are carried out in either Ireland or the European Economic Area (EEA)\nWhich documents are needed to qualify for RnD tax credits?\nWhat paperwork do I need to submit to get the R&D tax credit?\nWhen requesting a tax credit for R&D, the IRS does not define what constitutes “adequate proof.” However, because it is the taxpayer’s responsibility to provide evidence, your company should save as much proof of your R&D endeavours as you can in case of an audit. Some of the records you need to have on hand are the following:\nPayroll data for personnel actively participating in research and development, as well as for personnel or managers in charge of them\nGeneral ledger reports that differentiate between company costs and suppliers connected to R&D\nCopies of the agreements and bills paid to any contractors that conduct third-party research for you\nMaintaining timesheets for meetings, payroll, work plans, and other events to demonstrate their connection to R&D\nDesign schematics, test results, blueprints, status updates, marketing materials, and any other paperwork that demonstrates how your study was conducted and its relevance\nCan the research tax credits for my small business be increased?\nThe R&D tax credit is available to small enterprises in a variety of ways. Small enterprises that meet the requirements may apply for tax credits to offset rising research costs. You must demonstrate that your costs have grown from the prior year of operation in order to be eligible for this credit.\nUp to $250,000 in payroll taxes may be deducted from this deduction if your eligible small company has no income tax obligation. Small enterprises that qualify must have yearly gross revenues of less than $5 million and five years of total gross receipts. As a result, even if your small firm isn’t currently making money, you may still claim tax credits for research costs.\nStartups may now use the federal R&D tax credit, even if they do not pay federal income tax, to offset up to $250,000 of their FICA payroll tax during their first five taxable years thanks to the PATH Act of 2015, which made the benefit permanent.\nThey must, however, have gross revenues in the tax credit year of no more than $5 million and no gross receipts in any of the five taxable years before to the tax credit year.\nRules for Business Tax Credit Limitations\nThe total of your Qualified Research Expenses (QRE), which might include salaries, contractor fees, and supplier prices, determines how much you are reimbursed in R&D tax credits. Most taxpayers’ QREs are made up almost entirely of wages.\nYour tax credit is only worth up to the amount of your tax bill that exceeds $20,000, as stated in Section 38 of the IRS tax law. A startup may not be able to immediately benefit from the R&D tax credit if it has little to no revenue or current-year tax burden. In this scenario, the firm will have carryforwards for unused R&D tax credits, but it will only be able to utilise them once the company is successful, at which point it may not require as much money for an R&D tax credit.\nIf you want to know more about the RnD tax program, you can get in touch with our qualified professionals and\nbook a 15-min free consultation\n.\nRelated Topic Blog\nLet’s grow together\nOccams believes in growing with our clients to achieve ultimate success.

With all the information out there, it’s easy to fall for myths that could end up costing you money or landing you in trouble with the IRS. In this blog post, we’ll explore 4 common tax myths and provide the facts you need to know before filing your return.\nIntroduction\nFiling your taxes can be a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. By knowing the facts and avoiding common tax myths, you can file your return with confidence and avoid potential penalties or audits. Let’s dive into the myths and uncover the truth.\nMyth #1: “I don’t need to file taxes if I didn’t earn enough income”\nMany people believe that if they didn’t earn a lot of money, they don’t need to file taxes. This is a common misconception. The truth is that even if you didn’t earn enough to owe taxes, you still need to file a tax return if your income exceeds certain thresholds. For example, in 2022, if you are a single filer under the age of 65, you need to file a tax return if your income is $12,950 or more. Failing to file a tax return when required to do so can result in penalties and interest charges.\nMyth #2: “I can deduct all my home office expenses”\nWith more people working from home, there has been an increase in the number of taxpayers claiming home office deductions. However, not all home office expenses are deductible. To qualify for the deduction, you must use a portion of your home regularly and exclusively for business purposes. Additionally, the deduction is limited to the income earned from your business.\nMyth #3: “I can avoid taxes by moving my money to offshore accounts”\nSome people believe that they can avoid paying taxes by moving their money to offshore accounts. However, this is illegal and can result in severe penalties and legal consequences. Additionally, the IRS has increased its efforts to crack down on offshore tax evasion, so it’s not worth the risk.\nMyth #4: “I don’t need to report cash transactions under $10,000”\nAnother common tax myth is that you don’t need to report cash transactions under $10,000. However, this is not true. Any cash transaction, regardless of the amount, must be reported if it involves a business or activity that is required to be licensed or registered with the federal government.\nConclusion\nFiling your taxes can be a complicated process, but by knowing the facts and avoiding common tax myths, you can file your return with confidence and avoid potential penalties or audits.

Budgets froze, projects dwindled, and the threat of layoffs hung heavy in the air. For many businesses, survival became a daily struggle, and retaining their valued employees seemed like a distant hope.\nBut amidst the frost, a ray of sunshine emerged: the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERC). This government program, designed to incentivize businesses to keep their staff on board during the pandemic, offered a lifeline to struggling companies like yours.\nAt Occams Advisory, we understand the anxieties of running a landscaping business, especially in the face of adversity. That’s why we’re dedicated to helping businesses like yours navigate the ERC and claim their rightful refunds. We’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of this program, not just in terms of financial relief, but also in the human stories it unfolds.\nTake Natalie, for example. The owner of a small landscaping company, she was initially skeptical about the ERC. The paperwork, the deadlines – it all felt overwhelming. But with our expert guidance and streamlined process, the burden was lifted. Three weeks later, the news arrived: Natalie’s company was due over $130,000 in ERC refunds.\nThe impact was immediate. Tears of relief replaced the winter chill, and “Thank you!” echoed through the call. It wasn’t just about the money; it was about the warmth of hope returning to a business facing a harsh winter.\nNatalie’s story is just one of many. The ERC has been a game-changer for countless landscaping businesses, providing them with the financial resources to retain their employees, weather the pandemic, and emerge stronger on the other side.\nBut the benefits go beyond the bottom line. The ERC has helped businesses like yours:\nBoost employee morale: Knowing they’re valued during a crisis fosters loyalty and engagement.\nInvest in training and development: With the financial cushion of the ERC, you can upskill your team and prepare for future growth.\nFocus on what matters: By reducing financial stress, you can free up your time and energy to focus on what truly drives your business.\nReal-Life Scenarios:\nWondering if the ERC is right for your business? Here are some scenarios where it could make a significant difference:\nYou’ve experienced a decline in revenue due to the pandemic.\nYou’ve had to reduce your workforce or implement temporary furloughs.\nYou’re struggling to keep up with payroll and benefits costs.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs my business eligible for the ERC?\nOur team of experts can help you determine your eligibility and maximize your potential refund.\nWhat documents do I need to provide?\nWe’ll guide you through the simple and streamlined process, ensuring you have everything you need.\nWhat are the deadlines for claiming for the ERC?\nWhile the program has ended, there are still opportunities to claim your refund for eligible wages paid in 2020 and 2021.\nConclusion:\nThe pandemic may have brought a harsh winter to the landscaping industry, but the ERC, with a little help from Occams Advisory, can bring back laughter.

It was a bumpy ride for most businesses. Just 24 percent of IT leaders said their companies experienced no downtime, according to data from Insight, and 44 percent experienced more than two weeks of downtime.\nBut the results have been overwhelmingly positive across sectors. Corporate America has learned that certain tasks and operations can be conducted remotely in a highly efficient way using today's communication resources and networking.\nAlthough we do not yet grasp what the equilibrium between on-site and remote work would be, drawing on the experiences of our recent experience will help minimise friction when and where we have to pivot again. Here are a couple of cases I have observed.\nOur customers are much more versatile than we thought before, and so are we.\nIn cities across the world, after stay-at - home directives went into effect, IT leaders had to ramp up programmes and pursue innovative solutions to challenges we had never encountered before to keep our staff up and working remotely.\nTo successfully navigate this transition, it was crucial to immediately have safe access to collaborative resources and equipment for thousands of team members. The crisis generated the necessity for my company to complete the conversion of our team members to Microsoft Teams and Cisco WebEx fast, providing our team members with the resources to communicate safely from anywhere, at any time.\nAs several other companies, equipment shortages, especially computers, have slowed us down. We found a fast remedy as a dealer for a major electronics company: buying laptops we had in our distribution centres, and imaging and deploying them in record time.\nImportantly, by\nconsumer apathy\nor opposition, we were not slowed down. Our team mates were with us right there, moving for our shared purpose of helping our clients in unusual circumstances. This experience taught us that members of our team are eager and ready to embrace new ways of operating more easily than we previously believed. And it proved that we can work quicker on big releases of technologies, as an IT team, while also retaining adequate controls and delivering good performance.\nThe insights that IT will give our businesses go way beyond technology.\nBefore the pandemic, most companies still had certain team members who were distant. It can be difficult, though, to be the only remote entity when everyone else is in the workplace. This can mean skipping casual sidebar discussions or not getting the ability to talk up in staff sessions as much as possible.\nToday, even more staff members are in the \"same place,\" collaborating remotely and supporting video conferencing and networking technologies. This reform was a great equaliser, creating a more egalitarian work climate for office staff in general. But, particularly for individuals who lead teams, there are difficulties. When you can't both be in the same place, how do you build a team dynamic? When \"managing by wandering around\" isn't practical, how do you inspire people?\nAs our peers in our respective organisations are beginning to understand, we already have the answers in IT. For us, it's nothing new to accomplish targets by scattered teams, with just partial co-locations. We still had people operating both remotely and during off-hours. We have already learned how simulated teams can be engaged and their effectiveness maximised.\nWhen firms start getting some workers back into the workplace, IT professionals have an opportunity to share their experiences and help their businesses draw on the positive behavioural improvements that occurred through the crisis. This could involve taking stock of main functions that can already be conducted together and designing operating models that generate continuity across diverse work environments.\nCovid-19, of course, pushed enterprises to make numerous more rapid technological improvements, from massively expanding consumer interactive experiences to rethinking customer service, and more. Yet no transition touched more staff members or provided more options than the surge in remote work to involve our teams differently. Now is the time for Us to look inward, develop outward and help our organisations establish new operating models that improve mobility and allow us in the new normal to better address the needs of our employees.\nArticle Credits -\nforbes.com\n#COVID19 #ITProfessionals #Growth&Innovation #LoadOnInternet\nRelated Topic Blog\nSteering MSMEs Toward the New North Star: Bitcoin\nRunning a small or mid-sized business is like sailing into the unknown.

Complexity adds uncertainty, guidance is lacking, and what appears to be an easy path may lead you off a cliff.\nWhile the ERC program has fully sunset, employers may still file claims for any credits they were entitled to in 2020 through the third quarter of 2021, and interest remains strong. Like a sign on a path warning of danger ahead, this item is intended to help mitigate risk for those still pursuing the ERC by (1) breaking down the suspension test into its core components and (2) shedding light on areas to proceed with caution. As an aside, this is a complex analysis with many moving parts, most of which are beyond the scope of this discussion, and consulting someone with experience is advisable.\nThe suspension test overview\nUnder the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, P.L. 116-136, and Notice 2021-20, an employer can be eligible for the ERC if it experiences a full or partial suspension or modification of operations due to COVID-19-related orders from an appropriate governmental authority. This is the suspension test, and it is one of three means for eligibility, the others being relatively objective determinations of whether a business experienced a “significant decline” in gross receipts or qualifies as a “recovery startup business.” Unlike those other methods of qualifying for the ERC, the suspension test is highly subjective, based on facts and circumstances, lacks a significant amount of guidance, and is subject to additional limitations. To help understand the test, it is best broken down into its core components.\nThe suspension test is a two-part test, applied on a quarterly basis, in which an employer must establish:\nIt is subject to a governmental order in effect, and\nThe order has more than a nominal impact on its business operations, either due to suspending them or requiring modifications to them.\nFor establishing that suspensions and modifications of business operations have occurred, Notice 2021-20 provides employers with safe-harbor tests, as will be discussed in more detail later. For a suspension, employers must show that\nmore than a nominal portion\nof business operations were affected. For a modification (for example, a change made to satisfy social-distancing requirements), employers must show that the modification caused\nmore than a nominal effect\non business operations. It is critical to distinguish between whether a suspension or modification has occurred in order to apply the relevant safe-harbor test. Employers with one or more components of their operations suspended or modified should strive to meet the applicable safe harbor, as failure to do so increases the risk that the IRS may challenge their eligibility. In the event an employer cannot meet a safe harbor, it still may be eligible for the ERC if it can otherwise show that the governmental order impacted business operations more than nominally.\nTest 1: Governmental order\nThe first part of the suspension test is whether the employer is subject to a relevant governmental order. Eligibility for the ERC under the suspension test requires an order, proclamation, or decree from a federal, state, or local government that limits commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID-19. The level of enforcement of the government order is irrelevant for these purposes. Notice 2021-20 indicates that an issuing state or local government must have jurisdiction over the employer’s operations.\nSatisfactory examples of a government order include a state governor’s mandating that all nonessential businesses must close until further notice, a city mayor’s requiring all businesses to limit occupancy to 50% of legal capacity, and a local health department’s ordering all establishments to close four hours early to clean and disinfect the premises to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Critically, note that in each instance, compliance is\nmandatory;\nconversely, government action that does not qualify would include a government official merely encouraging diligence in maintaining social distancing or avoiding unnecessary travel or guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as compliance is voluntary.\nIt is highly recommended that employers save copies of the applicable governmental orders, identify the effective date ranges of the orders and the applicable language impacting the employer, and provide a robust narrative detailing the specific impacts of the order on their operations. As noted above, while an employer can still be eligible for the ERC under the suspension test if it does not meet either of the safe harbors, discussed below, that scenario demands a detailed and compelling narrative that establishes that the government order imposed more than a nominal impact on business operations.\nTest 2.a: Suspension: More-than-nominal portion\nThe second part of the suspension test is whether the government order has more than a nominal impact on business operations. There are two available safe harbors for demonstrating this. To the extent an employer’s operations are\nsuspended,\nthe employer should utilize the more-than-nominal\nportion\nsafe-harbor test. Under this test, the impacted portion of an employer’s operations will be deemed “more than nominal” for the quarter in which the employer is testing eligibility if either:\nThe gross receipts from that portion of the business make up at least 10% of the employer’s total gross receipts (both determined using the gross receipts from the same calendar quarter in 2019); or\nThe hours of service performed by employees in that portion of the business make up at least 10% of the employer’s total employee service hours (both determined using the service hours performed by employees in the same calendar quarter in 2019).\nExample 1:\nA restaurant must close (i.e., a suspension of business) its on-site dining due to a governmental order (test 1 met). The restaurant is allowed to continue sales to the public via carryout and delivery. Because it can no longer offer on-site dining, which represented 30% of the restaurant’s total gross receipts in the same quarter of 2019, a more-than-nominal portion of operations has been impacted (test 2.a met). As both parts of the suspension test are met after applying the appropriate safe harbor, the restaurant is eligible for the ERC.\nCaution:\nThis “lookback” test considers historical information from 2019. While at face value it seems simple, the guidance is not clear on how the factors (i.e., numerator and denominator) should be considered for complex organizational structures (e.g., franchises in multiple jurisdictions with varying levels of suspension, aggregated employers with multiple separate and distinct trades or businesses, etc.). Without clearer guidance on how to utilize the safe harbor for these complex scenarios, questions remain as to how to apply the test properly.\nTest 2.b: Modification: More-than-nominal effect\nTo the extent an employer’s operations are\nmodified\n, the employer should utilize the more-than-nominal\neffect\nsafe-harbor test. Under this test, a modification will have more than a nominal effect if it results in a 10% or more reduction in an employer’s ability to provide goods or services in its normal course of business.\nExamples of ordered modifications that\nmay\nresult in a more-than-nominal effect (note the authors’ caution below) include:\nRequiring occupancy restrictions and six-foot distancing; and\nRequiring performance of services only on an appointment basis.\nExamples of modifications that likely do not result in a more-than-nominal effect include:\nRequiring employees and customers to wear face coverings; and\nInstalling plexiglass or other barriers.\nExample 2:\nAssume the same facts as Example 1, except three months later under a further governmental order (test 1 met), the restaurant is permitted to offer indoor dining service, subject to a 50% capacity restriction (modification). This capacity restriction results in the restaurant having to turn away customers from eating indoors, and indoor sales are down considerably compared with the normal course (25% decrease in customers served, compared with the same quarter in 2019, showing a more-than-nominal effect (test 2.b met)). As both parts of the suspension test are met after applying the appropriate safe harbor, the restaurant is eligible for the ERC.\nCaution:\nThe mere existence of a modification, including occupancy restrictions and requiring appointments for services, is insufficient. An employer must still establish that the mandated modification had more than a nominal effect on business operations, which can be demonstrated by showing a 10% or more reduction in the employer’s ability to provide goods or services in its normal course of business. Unfortunately, Notice 2021-20 fails to provide quantifiable parameters by which this 10% reduction can be measured. As stated above, without clearer guidance, questions remain as to proper administration of the safe-harbor test.\nOther considerations\nThere are also additional matters to consider in determining whether an employer qualifies for the ERC.\nComparable operations via telework:\nSome employers found themselves subject to governmental orders closing their workplaces entirely. At face value, this may seem like a clear-cut case to establish eligibility, yet this too requires additional analysis. In these situations, the employer still must establish that it was unable to continue comparable operations via telework. Notice 2021-20 provides four factors to consider when determining whether the employer could continue comparable operations via telework:\nEmployer’s teleworking capabilities;\nPortability of employees’ work;\nNeed for presence in employee’s physical workspace; and\nDifficulty or delays in transitioning to telework operations.\nLimitations on qualified wages:\nTwo often-overlooked limitations apply to the suspension test:\nLimitation to the period the order was in effect:\nAn employer may only count as qualified wages those wages for the period that the order was in effect. For example, an employer’s operations may have been temporarily suspended for two weeks in the second quarter of 2020. Only wages pertaining to that two-week period can be treated as qualified, not all wages for the second quarter of 2020.\nLimitation on trade or business:\nThe law and guidance appear to limit qualified wages to the specific trade or business that was suspended, and not all wages paid to all employees of the employer if the employer comprises multiple trades or businesses. Unfortunately, available guidance does not appear to contemplate this scenario, and the analysis is further complicated for employers spanning multiple jurisdictions.\nBe cautious about taking aggressive positions\nWhere clear guidance is unavailable, ERC positions should be based on reasonable interpretations of current law and supplemental authority. The ERC was intended to provide relief to employers from the impact of COVID-19 but was not intended to be universally available. It seems clear the IRS will be examining credits claimed with intense scrutiny, as evidenced by Congress’s extending the statute of limitation for assessment of payroll tax returns on which the ERC is claimed to five years (Sec. 3134(l)) and the issuance of Treasury regulations directing erroneous ERC claims to be treated as underpayments of payroll taxes and subject to assessment (T.D. 9904). Interest and penalties can additionally be assessed on erroneously claimed credits.\nEmployers deciding on their ERC position should also consider the significant cumulative costs of a failure to sustain the ERC upon audit, including costs to calculate the credit, compliance costs related to amended filings for claims and subsequent amendments to repay, costs to defend the position upon audit or in court, and the actual repayment. Further, it is possible that the ERC audit might not conclude until after the statute of limitation has expired for the income tax return on which the employer appropriately did not claim deductions for wages giving rise to the credit, as required by CARES Act, Section 2301(e), and Sec. 3134(e). In this case, the employer would be unable to amend its income tax return to take the deductions, meaning it effectively paid tax on a credit it had to repay. Employers should consider these risks carefully and determine whether they are comfortable with the levels of exposure before proceeding.\nSome ill-advised arguments when pursuing the ERC under the suspension test include:\nThe employer was following nonmandatory guidance issued by the CDC and/or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;\nThe employer relied on the narrowly applicable suspended-supplier exception on account of macro-level supply chain bottlenecks (including supply shipments stuck at ports); and\nThere were increases in costs in order to successfully maintain pre-pandemic levels of operation.\nSeek all available resources\nThe ERC rules are complex, and guidance, while limited, includes substantial warnings for employers that aggressively interpret the rules or fail to conduct appropriate due diligence before reporting the credit. The AICPA has many resources to help members understand the rules (see\nEmployee Retention Credit Guidance and Resources\n). The authors recommend that you use all available resources when it comes to the ERC.\nRelated Topic Blog\n41% of small businesses can't pay rent this month\n(The Center Square) – More than 40% of U.S. small business owners say they couldn’t pay rent on time or in full for the month of November, the highest this year.

It’s more than just making things “look pretty”—it’s about strategic intent, understanding human perception, and harnessing the power of visuals to drive tangible results.\nThe power of graphic design lies far beyond its surface appeal. It is a strategic tool that builds brand equity, fosters user connection, and drives measurable results. As a graphic designer in today’s age, I must stay attuned to the evolving visual landscape, including the pivotal trends shaping 2025, such as\nhyper-realism, font prominence, and art-directed AI tools.\nThis is essential for maintaining relevance and impact. These trend tools, when wielded with skill and strategic intent, allow us to communicate more effectively and shape perceptions in an overcrowded marketplace. Focusing on clear, informed, and forward-thinking design is like investing in the clarity, competitiveness, and future success of your brand.\nThe Role of a Graphic Designer\nAs a graphic designer, I am responsible for crafting visual concepts that communicate ideas and captivate audiences. By combining creativity with technical skills, I develop layouts, illustrations, and branding materials that support marketing strategies and enhance brand recognition. Whether working on digital content, print media, or visual identity systems, I ensure consistency, clarity, and aesthetic appeal in every project. My ability to transform complex ideas into compelling visuals makes me an essential part of any creative or marketing team.\nThe Indispensable Value of Graphic Design for Companies\nI believe graphic designers offer significant value to a company by elevating brand recognition, enhancing user experience, and driving engagement that can lead to increased sales and conversions. Through strategic use of\ncolor, typography, imagery, and layout,\nI craft cohesive visual identities that resonate with target audiences. I also help streamline communication materials, support marketing initiatives, and contribute to consistent branding across all platforms. My creative expertise not only improves visual appeal but also plays a key role in shaping perception, building trust, and boosting a company’s overall competitiveness and return on investment.\nBrand Identity and Recognition:\nI meticulously craft visual identities that are unique, memorable, and instantly recognizable, fostering strong brand recall and loyalty.\nUser Experience and Innovation:\nMy designs prioritize intuitive navigation and engaging visuals, leading to a seamless and enjoyable user experience that drives engagement and satisfaction.\nIncreased Sales and Conversions:\nBy creating compelling visuals that communicate value and inspire action, I directly contribute to higher conversion rates and increased revenue.\nCost Efficiency and Time Savings:\nA well-defined visual strategy and consistent design assets, which I develop, reduce the need for constant redesigns and inconsistencies, saving both time and resources in the long run.\nCollaboration and Teamwork:\nI seamlessly integrate with marketing, sales, and product development teams, ensuring that visual communication aligns with overarching business goals and objectives.\nThe Importance of Graphic Design Trends\nFrom my perspective, graphic design trends are not merely fleeting fads; they are vital indicators of cultural shifts and evolving consumer psychology. By understanding and actively integrating these trends into my work, I ensure that the projects I create communicate and connect with your audience in a timely and relevant way. It’s a testament to my continuous learning and my deep engagement with how consumer interests are evolving.\nAs writer and activist, Toni Cade Bambara famously said, “The role of the artist is to make revolution irresistible.” In other words, graphic design trends aren’t only a sign of the times, they’re sometimes a catalyst to change themselves! I see myself as an artist in this sense, shaping visual narratives that can spark new ideas and drive progress.\nKey Graphic Design Trends for 2025\nHere are the graphic design trends of 2025 that I’m observing and actively incorporating into my strategic design approach:\nDiversity and Inclusion:\nWhile diversity and representation should undeniably be an industry standard and not a fleeting choice, it continues to become more of a priority amongst brands and designers. As a designer, I’m committed to pushing this forward. In graphic design, it means we’re seeing more faces and people in design. But not the standard picture-perfect models. We’re seeing more tattoos, more unique fashion and hair choices, more diversity, and more acceptance of the human body just the way it is. Woohoo!\nExample: The\n“Now add you” campaign by Sickdogwolfman for Moro\nexemplifies designers diving into diversity unapologetically, highlighting the many looks, perspectives, and lifestyles of the beautiful people on earth. Our strengths as a society lie in our varying outlooks on life. Why not celebrate it?\nAI Realism:\nOne of the newest graphic design trends to hit the scene, and one I’m particularly excited about, is the strategic use of\nAI platforms and tools.\nWhile this might seem counter-intuitive to some, I’m using my creative mind to art-direct AI tools and take graphic design to the next level. We’re seeing hyper-realistic visuals of storefronts, and digital art that resembles hand-drawn illustrations created by digital artists.\nReddit’s rebranding\nis a prime example, being one of the first brands to embody this trend with its 3D mascot and logo symbol.\nExample:\nOri, designed by Red Antler\n, also leverages AI imagery and technology to create surreal visuals, demonstrating the boundless potential of this integration.\nMaximum Contrast:\nI’ve always believed in the power of visual impact, and maximum contrast is a trend that truly delivers. This involves using stark differences in\ncolor, size, and even texture\nto create designs that immediately grab attention and guide the viewer’s eye. Think bold, opposing colors, large-scale typography paired with delicate accents, or smooth surfaces juxtaposed with rough textures. This trend is not just about aesthetics; it’s about making a powerful statement and ensuring your message cuts through the noise.\nFonts at the Forefront:\nLast year we saw experimental font trends take over graphic design. But this year, that’s changed… Just kidding! Exciting fonts are still in, but the words themselves are being used as the focal point. Sometimes the right words in the right font pack a bigger punch than all the design tricks in the book.\nExample: Consider the bold and conversational take that\nSlather\nused for their sunscreen. The font choice elevates the word itself into a memorable brand element.\nI’ve also found display fonts are taking center stage as I experiment with how far legibility boundaries can be pushed while maintaining clarity. Display fonts can vary significantly, but I predict a rise in\nelongated and handwritten fonts and abstract lettering.\nNote: As a responsible designer, I always exercise caution with this trend. Sacrificing legibility for cutting-edge design can backfire, and the goal is always clear communication.\nDoodles and Handwriting:\nIn an increasingly digital world, the human touch of doodles and handwriting offers a refreshing sense of authenticity and personality. I find that incorporating these elements can make a brand feel more approachable, relatable, and unique. Whether it’s a hand-drawn illustration, a playful annotation, or a custom handwritten font, these elements can add warmth and charm that more polished designs sometimes lack.\nAnti-Design:\nThis is where things get interesting for me. Anti-design challenges traditional notions of beauty and order, embracing\nasymmetry, unconventional layouts, and even what some might perceive as “ugliness.”\nIt’s a rejection of overly polished and predictable aesthetics, aiming to disrupt and provoke. I see this as an opportunity to create truly unique and memorable experiences, pushing the boundaries of what’s expected and making a strong statement.\nSimple Geometry:\nWhile some trends embrace complexity, I also see a powerful resurgence in simple geometry. Clean lines, basic shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, and minimalist compositions create a sense of calm, order, and sophistication. This trend is about clarity and efficiency, using fundamental forms to communicate ideas directly and effectively. It’s a timeless approach that emphasizes strong visual hierarchy and impactful messaging.\nBiophilic Design:\nAs we spend more time in digital spaces, there’s a growing desire for connection with nature. Biophilic design in graphic elements incorporates\nnatural patterns, textures, and organic forms,\noften with earthy color palettes. I find that this trend can evoke a sense of tranquility, well-being, and environmental consciousness, making brands feel more grounded and harmonious. Think botanical illustrations, leaf motifs, and natural gradients.\nConclusion\nBy understanding and strategically applying these trends, I aim to consistently deliver designs that are not only visually compelling but also deeply impactful, driving growth and success for the brands I work with.\nWritten by Sandeep Dolas – Sr. Graphic Designer, Occams Advisory.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Images of mountains of paperwork, confusing jargon, and stern-faced agents flash before our eyes. But fear not, taxpayers! An audit doesn’t have to be a nightmare. With the right knowledge and preparation, you can navigate the process with confidence and minimize any potential stress or tax burdens. Occams Advisory is here to equip you with five essential tips to turn that audit from a monster under the bed into a manageable bump in the road.\nReal Life Scenarios:\nImagine this:\nYou receive a notice from the IRS requesting additional information about your tax return. While initial panic is understandable, remember, audits are routine and not necessarily a sign of wrongdoing.\nAnother scenario:\nYou’ve relied heavily on a tax professional for your return. While their expertise is valuable, it’s crucial to understand potential conflicts of interest with “promoters” pushing questionable tax schemes.\nFAQs\nDo I need a lawyer for an IRS audit?\nIt depends on the complexity of the audit and your comfort level. Consider seeking legal counsel for high-stakes audits or if you feel overwhelmed.\nWhat happens if I disagree with the IRS findings?\nYou have the right to appeal the outcome. Consult with a tax professional to discuss your options and initiate the appeals process.\nHow long does an audit typically take?\nIt can vary significantly depending on the scope and complexity of the audit. Simple audits might be resolved within weeks, while complex ones can take months or even longer.\nCan I deduct the cost of a tax professional for an audit?\nYes, in most cases, professional fees related to IRS audits are deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions.\nWhat happens if I don't respond to the IRS about an audit?\nIgnoring the IRS can worsen the situation. Failing to respond can lead to penalties and additional tax assessments.\n5 Essential Tips:\nKnow Your Rights and Resources\n: Before the first knock on the door, familiarize yourself with the rights and resources available to you. The IRS website is your friend, offering a wealth of information on audit procedures, taxpayer rights, and even downloadable guides. Understand what the IRS can and cannot do, and don’t hesitate to consult with a qualified tax professional if you need additional guidance.\nOrganization is Key\n: The audit process is all about paperwork. Gather your tax returns, receipts, and any relevant communication with the IRS in a well-organized system. This not only saves you time and stress, but also demonstrates professionalism and preparedness to the IRS agent. Remember, a well-organized taxpayer is a confident taxpayer.\nHonesty is the Best Policy (Sometimes)\n: While the temptation to hide any potential errors or discrepancies might be strong, consider the long-term consequences. Coming clean early on, with accurate documentation, can often lead to a more favorable outcome. The IRS appreciates transparency, and proactively addressing mistakes showcases your willingness to cooperate and rectify the situation.\nBuild Your Case Like a Pro\n: Don’t just passively accept the IRS’s findings. Research your case! Utilize the Internal Revenue Manual, case law, and tax regulations to support your claims. Prepare clear and concise responses to anticipated questions, and practice your communication skills. Remember, the clearer and more articulate you are, the better chance you have of defending your position.\nSeek Professional Guidance When Needed\n: Don’t be afraid to call in the cavalry! Complex audits, unfamiliar tax situations, or simply feeling overwhelmed? Consulting with a qualified tax attorney or CPA can be invaluable. They can provide expert advice, represent you during the audit, and ensure your rights are protected throughout the process. Remember, investing in professional guidance can save you time, money, and a whole lot of stress.\nBeyond the Tips:\nThese five essential tips are just the foundation for a successful audit experience. Remember, knowledge is power, and staying informed can significantly reduce your anxiety. Stay up-to-date on tax laws and regulations, and don’t hesitate to ask questions. Occams Advisory is always here to provide you with reliable information and expert guidance.\nConclusion:\nAn IRS audit doesn’t have to be a terrifying experience. By equipping yourself with the right knowledge, preparation, and resources, you can navigate the process with confidence and emerge unscathed—or even with a newfound understanding of your tax obligations. Remember, Occams Advisory is your partner in audit preparedness, ready to support you every step of the way.

Financial technology (“fintech”) companies are improving efficiency and transparency, broadening equity, access, and inclusion, reducing costs, and expanding choice and opportunities for consumers and businesses by using internet and mobile platforms, machine learning, automation, and other modern technologies to deliver financial products and services.\nThough internet, mobile, and computing technologies have been spreading throughout financial markets and services for decades, COVID-19 set off significant global upheavals in 2020, accelerating these developments. Economic inequities are becoming more visible, and the desire for change is growing. Government relief efforts have been delayed as a result of distribution or technical inadequacies, highlighting the need to modernise financial infrastructure in the United States. Consumer behaviour and tastes have continued to alter in the face of a continuous public health crisis, economic instability, and unique societal limitations.\nAs individuals have gotten more used to digital access, fintech solutions have emerged as important tools for bridging our real and virtual activities. Consumers are now more inclined to move their money online as they earn, save, and invest for the long term, rather of physically exchanging cash with staff at checkout. Large and small businesses alike are quickly adapting to these developments by improving their digital services. Though the COVID-19 epidemic will ultimately pass, the financial environment will continue to shift as fintech solutions become more integrated into our everyday lives.\nFrom the creation of the abacus to the gigantic supercomputers that are used to run sophisticated financial models today, technology and finance have always been inextricably linked. As a result of this combination, the fintech sector was formed, and currently the bulk of financial activity is conducted on mobile phones, allowing more individuals to access financial services.\nApart from broadening access, technology has ushered in a slew of significant changes to financial institutions throughout the world, upending whole industries in certain cases, such as\nmobile investing applications\nand stockbrokers. However, the fintech revolution is ongoing, and clever entrepreneurs are driving some of the most important themes that will shape the future of banking.\nProtection\nSecurity has been one of the key problems that all stakeholders have had to deal with as financial services have migrated from face-to-face to remote contacts. Ransomware payments are quickly becoming a normal operational expenditure for many businesses as cybercrime continues to increase at an alarming rate.\nTo address this, biometric solutions are becoming more popular as a means of obtaining the greatest levels of security possible, as biometric markers are difficult to duplicate or hack. Fingerprints have long been the gold standard, but public health concerns are driving interest in contactless biometrics identification.\nBanking that is open to the public\nTo maintain a competitive edge, financial organisations have always guarded their client data with zeal. This has generally included restricting access to prospective rivals, but it has also frequently seen banks deny consumers complete ownership over their data. Due to increased data protection regulations that enable consumers to access and transfer their data as they choose, as well as more collaboration between fintech businesses and traditional banks, the open banking idea has experienced a comeback in recent years.\nRegtech\nGovernments and regulatory agencies across the globe have been playing catch-up with new laws and regulations to cover each new breakthrough as fintech businesses have continued to create solutions on new technologies. Fintech businesses now have to cope with a patchwork of rules in each nation where they operate as a result of this.\nAdoption of cryptocurrencies\nFar from the early days when cryptocurrencies were on the outskirts, major financial services businesses began to use them in 2020. In November, PayPal stated that all U.S.-based customers will be able to purchase, store, and trade cryptocurrencies on its platform.\nAs the number of people who utilise cryptocurrencies grows, so will the number of businesses that accept them. Because cryptocurrencies have downsides (such as security and volatility), the market will reward firms who can supply solutions to those shortcomings.\nPayments through mobile device\nCash is not extinct. Yet. However, as the world moves away from personal touch and mobile payment methods become more widely available, it is definitely on its way out. Mobile payments have become a focus in the financial services sector, from tiny startups to technology behemoths like Apple and Google.\n#FinanceFuture #TechnologyImpact #ArtificialIntelligence #Internet #VirtualActivities\nArticle Credits –\nftassociation.org and entrepreneur.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nSupreme Court Upholds Tax on Foreign Investments in Moore vs...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Understanding the MRT Provision    The Prosecution’s Argument Victory For the Status Quo Good News For the Moore Wealthy Introduction On June 20th, t...\nRead More\nThe Role of Collections and Customer Service in Contemporary...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Building Customer Relationships:  Effective Communication and Transparency:  Leveraging Technology for Efficiency and Personalization Driving Financi...\nRead More\nIs there a tax deduction for corporate insurance?\nThe cost of business insurance is normally deductible from gross profits for small business owners.

Effective collections and customer service strategies are pivotal in achieving this equilibrium, not only for financial well-being but also for fostering a positive customer experience. This blog elucidates the invaluable contributions of collection and customer service departments to businesses and underscores their indispensable role in the modern economy.\nBuilding Customer Relationships:\nCustomer service has transcended its traditional role of merely addressing complaints or answering inquiries. It now encompasses the cultivation of meaningful relationships with customers. Contemporary consumers anticipate personalized, empathetic, and timely interactions. When customer service teams demonstrate genuine interest in resolving issues, it not only expedites solutions but also enhances customer loyalty. In fact, a satisfactory customer service experience can transform potentially negative encounters, such as billing or collections-related matters, into opportunities for strengthening customer loyalty.\nEffective Communication and Transparency:\nA crucial aspect of contemporary collections is the practice of transparent and honest communication. The era of confrontational demands for payments has passed, replaced by an approach that emphasizes explaining payment options, offering flexibility where feasible, and conveying empathy. When customers feel informed and respected, they are more inclined to respond positively, even in situations where payments are overdue.\nBy fostering transparency in collections, businesses establish a supportive environment that encourages customers to proactively seek assistance. When customers comprehend the rationale behind collection actions and perceive options that align with their circumstances, it becomes easier for them to cooperate and find mutually agreeable solutions.\nAn empathetic approach to collections can yield significantly better outcomes compared to aggressive or impersonal tactics. By humanizing the collections process, teams demonstrate a company’s commitment to comprehending each customer’s unique circumstances. For instance, offering extensions or adjusting payment plans based on a customer’s individual financial situation fosters goodwill and encourages timely payments. Empathy-driven collections not only enhance collection rates but also safeguard a company’s reputation.\nLeveraging Technology for Efficiency and Personalization\nTechnology has revolutionized both collections and customer service, enhancing efficiency and personalization. Automation streamlines processes, such as sending reminders or managing payment schedules, liberating customer service representatives to focus on complex cases that require personalized attention. Chatbots, artificial intelligence (AI), and data-driven insights enable companies to anticipate customer needs and tailor communication accordingly.\nFor instance, AI can analyze customer payment histories to suggest optimal times for collections or identify potential issues proactively. By integrating technology with human interaction, companies can optimize the customer experience while achieving operational efficiencies.\nDriving Financial Health and Business Growth\nSuccessful collections process directly impacts a company’s financial performance, ensuring a consistent cash flow and facilitating growth. When companies prioritize collections as an integral component of their financial strategy, they mitigate the risk of outstanding debts hindering operations. In the current economic climate, where cash flow is paramount for business resilience, collections play a pivotal role in determining a company’s financial health.\nFurthermore, well-managed collections can liberate resources that can be reinvested in customer service initiatives or product development. When collections are conducted with a customer-centric approach, businesses can achieve financial stability without compromising customer relationships.\nCompliance and Ethical Standards\nIn today’s business landscape,\nstringent regulations govern debt collection and customer data protection, necessitating compliance as a paramount priority. Collections departments must ensure their practices align with legal standards, including providing transparent terms, adhering to privacy regulations, and treating customers with fairness. Compliance extends beyond legal requirements; it reflects a company’s ethical principles.\nWhen collections and customer service teams operate within ethical and legal guidelines, they uphold the company’s reputation and contribute to a positive brand image. This commitment to ethical practices has gained increasing significance among consumers, who prioritize transparency and fairness in their interactions with businesses.\nConclusion\nThe Future of Collections and Customer Service: Adaptability and Innovation\nAs customer expectations evolve and economic conditions fluctuate, collections and customer service must remain adaptable and innovative. Embracing a proactive approach, investing in technology, and adapting to changes will ensure business resilience and competitiveness. Future trends may include the increased utilization of predictive analytics, advanced self-service options, and more collaborative approaches to managing payments.\nIn conclusion, collections and customer service are interconnected entities that support financial health and customer satisfaction. By prioritizing empathy, transparency, and technological advancements, companies can establish enduring relationships with their customers, foster trust, and drive sustainable growth. In today’s business environment, these two departments are not merely operational necessities; they are potent tools for creating a positive, customer-centric experience that benefits both businesses and their clients.\nWritten by\nMaria Antonio, AVP- Client Relations, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Images of mountains of paperwork, confusing jargon, and stern-faced agents flash before our eyes. But fear not, taxpayers! An audit doesn’t have to be a nightmare. With the right knowledge and preparation, you can navigate the process with confidence and minimize any potential stress or tax burdens. Occams Advisory is here to equip you with five essential tips to turn that audit from a monster under the bed into a manageable bump in the road.\nReal Life Scenarios:\nImagine this:\nYou receive a notice from the IRS requesting additional information about your tax return. While initial panic is understandable, remember, audits are routine and not necessarily a sign of wrongdoing.\nAnother scenario:\nYou’ve relied heavily on a tax professional for your return. While their expertise is valuable, it’s crucial to understand potential conflicts of interest with “promoters” pushing questionable tax schemes.\nFAQs\nDo I need a lawyer for an IRS audit?\nIt depends on the complexity of the audit and your comfort level. Consider seeking legal counsel for high-stakes audits or if you feel overwhelmed.\nWhat happens if I disagree with the IRS findings?\nYou have the right to appeal the outcome. Consult with a tax professional to discuss your options and initiate the appeals process.\nHow long does an audit typically take?\nIt can vary significantly depending on the scope and complexity of the audit. Simple audits might be resolved within weeks, while complex ones can take months or even longer.\nCan I deduct the cost of a tax professional for an audit?\nYes, in most cases, professional fees related to IRS audits are deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions.\nWhat happens if I don't respond to the IRS about an audit?\nIgnoring the IRS can worsen the situation. Failing to respond can lead to penalties and additional tax assessments.\n5 Essential Tips:\nKnow Your Rights and Resources\n: Before the first knock on the door, familiarize yourself with the rights and resources available to you. The IRS website is your friend, offering a wealth of information on audit procedures, taxpayer rights, and even downloadable guides. Understand what the IRS can and cannot do, and don’t hesitate to consult with a qualified tax professional if you need additional guidance.\nOrganization is Key\n: The audit process is all about paperwork. Gather your tax returns, receipts, and any relevant communication with the IRS in a well-organized system. This not only saves you time and stress, but also demonstrates professionalism and preparedness to the IRS agent. Remember, a well-organized taxpayer is a confident taxpayer.\nHonesty is the Best Policy (Sometimes)\n: While the temptation to hide any potential errors or discrepancies might be strong, consider the long-term consequences. Coming clean early on, with accurate documentation, can often lead to a more favorable outcome. The IRS appreciates transparency, and proactively addressing mistakes showcases your willingness to cooperate and rectify the situation.\nBuild Your Case Like a Pro\n: Don’t just passively accept the IRS’s findings. Research your case! Utilize the Internal Revenue Manual, case law, and tax regulations to support your claims. Prepare clear and concise responses to anticipated questions, and practice your communication skills. Remember, the clearer and more articulate you are, the better chance you have of defending your position.\nSeek Professional Guidance When Needed\n: Don’t be afraid to call in the cavalry! Complex audits, unfamiliar tax situations, or simply feeling overwhelmed? Consulting with a qualified tax attorney or CPA can be invaluable. They can provide expert advice, represent you during the audit, and ensure your rights are protected throughout the process. Remember, investing in professional guidance can save you time, money, and a whole lot of stress.\nBeyond the Tips:\nThese five essential tips are just the foundation for a successful audit experience. Remember, knowledge is power, and staying informed can significantly reduce your anxiety. Stay up-to-date on tax laws and regulations, and don’t hesitate to ask questions. Occams Advisory is always here to provide you with reliable information and expert guidance.\nConclusion:\nAn IRS audit doesn’t have to be a terrifying experience. By equipping yourself with the right knowledge, preparation, and resources, you can navigate the process with confidence and emerge unscathed—or even with a newfound understanding of your tax obligations. Remember, Occams Advisory is your partner in audit preparedness, ready to support you every step of the way.

It Wasn’t Just Procrastination\nSep 30 2022 |\nOccams Marketing\n172\n0\n▷\nIntroduction\n▷\nReal-Life Scenario\n▷\nConclusion\n▷\nFAQs\n▷\nSources and Citations\nTax Day is Coming: 19 Million Americans Needing Extensions\nAs Tax Day approaches, a record-breaking number of Americans have filed for tax extensions. In this blog post, we’ll explore why so many people are filing for extensions, what to do if you need to file an extension, and provide tips for filing your taxes correctly and avoiding potential penalties.\nIntroduction\nTax Day is the deadline for filing federal income tax returns in the United States. For the 2022 tax year, the deadline is April 18th, due to the observance of Emancipation Day. However, a record-breaking number of Americans have filed for tax extensions this year, indicating that many people are struggling to meet the deadline.\nWhy Are So Many Americans Filing for Extensions?\nThere are many reasons why someone might file for a tax extension. For example, they may need additional time to gather all the necessary documentation, or they may be experiencing financial difficulties that make it difficult to pay their taxes on time. Additionally, the pandemic has created a unique set of challenges for taxpayers, such as delays in receiving tax forms and changes to tax laws.\nReal-Life Scenario #1\nLet’s say a self-employed individual has experienced a significant decrease in income due to the pandemic. As a result, they are struggling to pay their taxes on time and have filed for an extension to avoid potential penalties.\nReal-Life Scenario #2\nNow let’s say a taxpayer has not received all their necessary tax forms due to pandemic-related delays. They may need additional time to gather all the necessary information and have filed for an extension to avoid making errors on their tax return.\nWhat to Do if You Need to File an Extension\nIf you need additional time to file your taxes, you can file for an extension using Form 4868. This form must be filed by the tax deadline, which for the 2022 tax year is April 18th. Filing an extension gives you an additional six months to file your tax return, but it does not give you additional time to pay your taxes.\nTips for Filing Your Taxes Correctly\nTo ensure that you file your taxes correctly and avoid potential penalties, here are some tips to keep in mind:\nGather all the necessary documentation\nDouble-check your math and calculations\nConsider hiring a tax professional for complex tax situations\nAvoiding Penalties for Late Filing\nFailing to file your tax return by the deadline can result in significant penalties and interest charges. If you are unable to pay your taxes on time, it’s still important to file your tax return by the deadline to avoid additional penalties. Additionally, you may be eligible for an installment agreement or an offer in compromise to help you pay your taxes over time.\nConclusion\nTax Day can be stressful, especially if you need to file for an extension. However, by taking the necessary steps to file your taxes correctly and avoid potential penalties, you can ensure a smooth tax season. If you are unsure about how to file your taxes or need help navigating the tax code, consider consulting with a tax professional.\nFAQs\nWhat is the deadline for filing federal income tax returns in the US?\nFor the 2022 tax year, the deadline is April 18th.\nWhat happens if I can't file my tax return by the deadline?\nFailing to file your tax return by the deadline can result in significant penalties and interest charges.\nCan I file for an extension to pay my taxes?\nFiling an extension gives you additional time to file your tax return, but it does not give you additional time to pay your taxes.\nShould I hire a tax professional to help me file my taxes?\nHiring a tax professional can be beneficial for complex tax situations or if you are unsure about how to file your taxes.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\nForbes: More Than 20 Million Taxpayers Face IRS Delays As Filing Deadline Approaches (\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2022/04/11/more-than-20-million-taxpayers-face-irs-delays-as-filing-deadline-approaches/?sh=55cb31456a47\n)\nIRS.gov: Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return (\nhttps://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-4868\n)\nTurboTax: Late Filing Penalties (\nhttps://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/late-filing-penalties/L2Gj7ghuQ\n)\nRelated Topic Blog\nThe Impact of Technology on the Future of Finance\nIn the United States, technology-driven innovation is changing the way we offer, access, and profit from financial services and markets.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), enacted in March 2020, aimed to provide economic relief to various segments of the population, including self-employed individuals. One of the key provisions of the FFCRA was the introduction of refundable tax credits for self-employed individuals who were unable to work due to the pandemic. This research paper explores how these Self Employed Tax Credits (SETC) have affected the financial stability of self-employed individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on the role of advisory firms like Occams Advisory in facilitating access to these credits.\nLiterature Review\nSeveral studies have highlighted the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-employed individuals. The pandemic-induced lockdowns and social distancing measures led to a significant reduction in business activities, causing a sharp decline in income for many self-employed individuals. The SETC were designed to mitigate these adverse effects by providing financial support to those who were unable to work due to illness, quarantine, or caregiving responsibilities.\nMethodology\nThis research paper utilizes a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative interviews. Data sources include IRS reports, surveys of self-employed individuals, and economic studies on the impact of the FFCRA. Charts and graphs are used to illustrate the trends and correlations observed in the data.\nQuantitative Analysis\nData Collection\nData was collected from the following sources:\nIRS reports on the disbursement of tax credits under the FFCRA.\nSurveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) and similar organizations.\nEconomic studies published by research institutions and universities.\nData Analysis\nThe data was analyzed to determine:\nThe total amount of tax credits disbursed to self-employed individuals.\nThe average amount received per individual.\nThe percentage of eligible individuals who claimed the credits.\nThe impact of these credits on the recipients’ financial stability, measured by changes in income, savings, and business continuity.\nResults\nTotal Disbursement of Tax Credits\nThe IRS reported a substantial total disbursement to self-employed individuals under the FFCRA. The distribution of these credits varied across different states and industries, with some regions and sectors receiving more support than others. Advisory services, such as those provided by Occams Advisory, have been instrumental in helping clients navigate these regional and sectoral variations.\nTotal Tax Credits Disbursed by State\nClaim Rate\nA notable portion of eligible self-employed individuals claimed the SETC. The claim rate was influenced by awareness of the program, ease of application, and the perceived adequacy of the credits. Firms like Occams Advisory have been pivotal in raising awareness and simplifying the application process for their clients.\nClaim Rate of SETC\nImpact on Financial Stability\nThe tax credits had a significant positive impact on the financial stability of self-employed individuals. Survey data indicated that recipients were able to maintain their income levels, avoid depleting their savings, and keep their businesses operational. Occams Advisory has received positive feedback from clients who successfully maintained their financial stability with the firm’s assistance.\nImpact of Tax Credits on Financial Stability\nQualitative Analysis\nInterviews with Self-Employed Individuals\nUsing Data points from Track the Recovery.org, Data was taken from a with a diverse group of individuals across different industries and states. Key themes that emerged from the data included:\nThe critical role of the tax credits in sustaining business operations during lockdowns.\nChallenges in understanding and applying for the credits.\nThe need for additional support beyond the FFCRA provisions.\nThe valuable guidance and support provided by advisory firms like Occams Advisory.\nDiscussion\nThe SETC provided essential financial relief to self-employed individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The quantitative data shows a substantial disbursement of funds and a significant positive impact on financial stability. However, the qualitative analysis highlights areas for improvement in the implementation and communication of such programs. Occams Advisory’s role in assisting clients underscores the importance of professional guidance in maximizing the benefits of such financial relief measures.\nConclusion\nThe SETC played a vital role in supporting self-employed individuals during a period of unprecedented economic disruption. While the overall impact was positive, future policies should address the identified challenges to enhance the effectiveness of financial relief measures. Advisory services like those offered by Occams Advisory have proven essential in helping self-employed individuals navigate these complex processes and secure the support they need.\nRecommendations\nIncrease Awareness:\nThe critical role of the tax credits in sustaining business operations during lockdowns.\nSimplify Application Processes:\nChallenges in understanding and applying for the credits.\nProvide Additional Support:\nThe need for additional support beyond the FFCRA provisions.\nLeverage Advisory Services:\nThe valuable guidance and support provided by advisory firms like Occams Advisory.\nReferences\nIRS Reports on FFCRA Disbursements\nNational Federation of Independent Business Surveys\nEconomic Studies on COVID-19 Impact\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation :\nClick here\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

He clarified that the lessons that auditors have learned over the years from dealing with consumers would mean very little in 2020.\n\"You may have to rip up this year's usual strategy and start fresh,\" said Graham. \"You have to look at this business as it is in 2020.\"\nMany public sector audits and certain private company audits use a control-based methodology, which Graham said depends strongly on the willingness of a customer to retain adequate financial management controls over the year. It also has the advantage of saving the inspector from having to perform a large amount of substantive research at the end of the year.\nBut in 2020, such a control-based approach could not be feasible.\nWere those checks really in effect throughout 2020? 'Asked Graham. Perhaps they were in January; perhaps they were in December. But what about the time in the middle? Did any of those safeguards slip by the wayside when the key entities were not there and company procedures changed? ”\nThe possibility that the safeguards of a client will be less reliable than in previous years will also determine how the interaction team approaches its sampling of customer accounts.\n\"If you don't get your leverage from your controls or if fraud risks are identified, the sample size that you used for your substantive revenue test and cost tests last year may have to be raised quite significantly,\" Graham said.\n\"If the operations were continuous, you could take a random sample of the entire population, as in many previous periods, and it would give you a reply with regard to the financial statements,\" he said. \"But you could have had very different activities this year.\" Certain industry lines could have begun to operate as they had during 2019 in the first couple of months of 2020, but the pandemic and lockout started a disruption with an end date that is still unknown.\n\"What you may want to do is stratify your sample so that the period that was abnormal is more intensively sampled,\" Graham said. When company gets back to normal late in the year, he said, auditors will want to more intensively sample the middle phase and look together at the start and end of the year.\nThe severe disruption to the economy from the pandemic threatens plunging many businesses into ruin, and private companies may pose higher risks than public companies.\nGraham reported that, traditionally, auditors face the possibility of lawsuits in about 80 percent of bankruptcies because the creditors of the client may accuse them of failure to recognise the degree to which the financial condition of the client declined prior to the bankruptcy. When a customer is purchased, the purchasing company may sue the auditor if the buyer discovers any failure after the sale is closed or considers mistakes in reporting in the newly acquired company that it decides it is significantly overpaid. Since it is all but inevitable that for the rest of 2020 and maybe until 2021, an exceptionally high increase in bankruptcies will mar the corporate climate, Graham predicts that litigation targeting auditors will also rise.\n\"That's going to be a dramatic environmental change,\" he added. The unusually extreme litigation threats facing the profession, in his opinion, put an increased urgency on carefully mapping the plan for each interaction and being exceptionally diligent in collecting the records and recording the facts reviewed while carrying out simple procedures such as sampling.\n\"You have a very interesting year, where the traditional auditing approach and the usual risk assessment approach may not be the same,\" Graham said.\nGraham said that the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 guidelines, Income From Arrangements With Consumers (Topic 606), offers a clear indication of the complexities of auditing sampling procedures after the pandemic.\n\"You should not issue an opinion that you can not defend from litigation exposure and professional standards perspectives,\" he said. \"This kind of atmosphere is going to place the auditor at risk to know where you really don't have enough evidence, with certainty of saying,' Sure. This sector is as presented at this point in the financial statements.\"\n#ENGAGE2020 #AICPA #AuditRisks #Pandemic #FASBAccounting\nArticle Credits –\njournalofaccountancy.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nIn 2021 and Beyond, Content Marketing Strategies for Breakth...\nContent marketing is still one of the most effective ways to generate leads and drive traffic to your website.

Yet there are some more dangerous threats than others. Here are a few threats that should be kept in mind by any company owner.\nRunning an organization needs hard work that can yield client benefits, sales and happiness. Although the ultimate goal is achievement, market risk can prevent you from achieving the goals you set.\nHowever, there are precautions you should take when it comes to risk assessment. Here are seven forms of market risk in your business that you might want to consider.\n1. Economic risk\nWhen the prices fluctuate, the economy continually adjusts. Any positive developments are beneficial for the economy, leading to a booming shopping climate, while profits can be diminished by negative incidents. To theoretically detect and brace for an economic slowdown, it is important to track shifts and patterns.\nSave as much capital as possible to sustain a stable cash balance to counteract economic risk. Often, as part of a strategic strategy, work on a lean budget with reduced overhead across all economic cycles.\n2. Chance for Compliance\nBusiness owners face an abundance of rules and legislation to deal with. For instance, recent compliance with data security and payment processing may change how you approach some facets of your operation. Staying well versed in existing legislation will help mitigate enforcement risks from federal agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as state and local agencies.\nIf you depend on all of your profits from one or two customers, if one or both no longer use your services, your financial risk may be important. To diversify your foundation, start selling your offerings so that the lack of one won't devastate your bottom line.\nIf you rely on all of your income from one or two clients, your financial burden can be substantial if one or more of them no longer use your services. To diversify your base, begin selling your offerings so that your bottom line will not be destroyed by the loss of one.\n3. Chance to Security and Fraud\nThere are now greater opportunities for hacking as more clients use online and smartphone platforms to exchange personal data. News reports on data hacks, identity theft and payment fraud show how companies are raising this kind of harm.\nThis vulnerability not only affects trust and credibility, but a corporation is also financially responsible for any data breaches or fraud. Focus on protection solutions, intrusion prevention software and employee and consumer education on how to spot any possible vulnerabilities in order to implement successful business risk management.\n4. Danger to Finance\nThis business risk could include credit extended to clients or the debt burden of your own business. Fluctuations of interest rates may also be a hazard.\nIt will help you prevent destroying cash flow or causing an unnecessary loss by making changes to your business strategy. Hold debt to a minimum and build a strategy that as soon as possible can help to lower that debt burden. If you depend on all of your profits from one or two customers, if one or both no longer use your services, your financial risk may be important. To diversify your foundation, start selling your offerings so that the lack of one won't devastate your bottom line.\n5. Damage to Credibility\nThere has always been the possibility that an angry client, product loss, bad press or litigation will negatively affect a company's brand image. However, the pace and reach of credibility harm has been exacerbated by social media. Just one adverse tweet or negative review will minimise the follow-up of your client and cause sales to plunge.\nLeverage identity management tactics to constantly track what people are thinking about the business online and offline to plan for this possibility. Be able to respond to such comments and quickly help resolve any questions. To deter litigation and product defects that can also harm the credibility of your company, keep quality top of mind.\n6. Damage of operations\nThis market risk may arise internally, externally, or a mixture of factors could be involved. Anything that causes you to lose business continuity can happen suddenly.\nA natural catastrophe or fire that affects or kills your physical company may be that unforeseen occurrence. Or, a server crash triggered by technological difficulties, entities, or power cuts may be involved. Often, certain organizational threats are people-related. An employee may make errors that cost money and time.\nIf it's a person or process malfunction, in terms of resources, time and credibility, these operating risks will adversely affect the business. Via preparation and a corporate continuity strategy, resolve each of these future operating threats. Both methods offer a way to learn about what could go wrong and build a contingency mechanism or preventive steps to ensure that events are not disrupted.\nFor starters, more organizations use cloud storage to safeguard business information and focus on remote team members to manage operations. It also tends to reduce human errors by automating further operations.\n7. Damage to Competition (or Comfort)\nWhile a company may be conscious that their market still has some competition, it's easy to lose out on what competitors deliver that may cater to your clients.\nIn this scenario, the market danger requires a business leader being so satisfied with their results and the status quo that they do not look at opportunities to pivot or make continuous adjustments. Increasing rivalry mixed with a lack of commitment to adapt will lead to consumer losses.\nEnterprise risk management suggests that an enterprise must constantly reassess its performance, optimise its methodology, and establish good, engaging partnerships with its clients and audience. In addition, by constantly studying how they use web and social media platforms, it is important to keep an eye on the market.\nAgree, but schedule\nWhile you will never be able to eradicate market risk entirely, it does help to prepare for it proactively. Knowledge is important to help you save money and time while maintaining the trust, credibility, and client base that you have worked so hard to attain.\n#BusinessRisks #CredibilityRisk #DangerToFinance #OperationalRisk\nArticle Credits –\namericanexpress.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nAccounting Firm Innovations as a Route to Growth\nBusinesses are continuously seeking to develop in the face of increased market competition.

That ended when the U.S. arrived in 1971. Completely separated from the gold standard, the dollar and other world monetary regimes accepted floating exchange rates.\nFor the past 50 years, in the face of fintech disruptions such as virtual currencies, electronic ledgers and decentralised protocols, financial institutions have developed payment networks that are partly obsolescent. Fintech founders are more attuned to the high demands of a youthful, digital crowd who with a touch of a phone button, buys products from across the world and can be shipped by Amazon in a few hours.\nBy being almost automatic, inexpensive and stable, frictionless networks such as distributed ledgers remove barriers to cross-border payments, remittances and data transfers. Such successful sales unlock greater economic growth and foster prosperity. In this way, new buyers can shift value with effectiveness and circumvent needless red tape.\nIn the payments industry, developers are developing new technologies and producing creative innovations that enable banks and customers to transact at any time, anywhere.\nSettlements in Real-time\nGlobal payment firms, unlike most businesses, must operate at the pace of now: receivers want their money immediately, and senders want to rapidly resolve matters. It's all about being frictionless, which means transferring digital money (or data) at low cost, in real time and without hassles at home or across borders.\nMillennials have a mentality distinct from past generations. Instant satisfaction and immediacy was welcomed by mainstream society. Most assume that transmitting digits from a sender's electronic screen to a receiver may not be that difficult.\nA next-generation payment network that makes real-time payments online and via smartphones was introduced by Japan-based Soramitsu last year. The blockchain technology of the venture is quicker, cheaper and solves development challenges such as when individuals are \"unbanked.\" For example, in Cambodia, 78 percent of the population above 15 years of age do not have access to banking services. The app registered thousands of actual users in six months.\nProject Bakong by Soramitsu helps participating banks and consumers to transact directly and more effectively through a network supervised by the central bank of Cambodia. It's the ultimate acceptance stamp. The organisation is also carrying out mobility solutions that give the unbanked population of Cambodia access to smartphone payment services.\nInoperativeness for other structures\nIn order to create legacy payment systems, banks have spent large amounts. Financial companies, however must now not only design structures and structures that integrate cutting-edge technologies, but also fulfil greater demands of customers. Legacy is incompatible with the networks of other banks or payment processors. When submitting and collecting orders, this leads to high rates, lengthy waits and annoyance with clients.\nTokenization\nsolves the interoperability problem by leveraging a common token that participants use to easily and securely pass value (or data). In the case of Soramitsu's Bakong Initiative, the network enables participants (i.e. banks) to use token transactions to transact directly. By avoiding conventional business procedures such as transition orders, liquidation and payment confirmations at a later date, this approach dramatically speeds up settlements.\nIn order to boost\nremittances\nbetween those nations, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand are also experimenting with QR scan codes. The QR codes are compliant with EMVCo and can be used to send and receive local currency denominated payments.\nThere are several businesses, banks, payment processors and remittance firms in the financial ecosystem. But having so influential members produces protocols, terminology and procedures that are divergent and incompatible. There is misunderstanding and red tape. And the net expense to the customer can be debilitating as each establishment charges a premium.\nFintech entrepreneurs are lowering payment obstacles, contributing to higher economic growth and new income. Innovations such as Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, tokenization and peer-to-peer networks are being looked into by digital-savvy customers. These are revolutionary innovations that demand the adaptation of a massive, entrenched ecosystem.\nArticle Credits –\nentrepreneur.com\n#FintechStartups #PaymentsIndustry #Entrepreneurs #DesigningProcesses #BuildingInnovativeSolutions\nRelated Topic Blog\n7 Things to Ask Your Investment Banker\nAlmost every growing firm will need to obtain cash at some point, whether by borrowing, an equity investment, or a merger.

Whether you’re considering mergers and acquisitions, raising capital, or seeking financial advisory services, asking the right questions will help you make an informed decision and maximize your investment opportunities. In this article, we will discuss the seven key questions you should ask your investment banker.\nWhy Choosing the Right Investment Banker is Crucial\nAn investment banker plays a pivotal role in executing complex financial transactions. They provide expertise, market insights, and a network of connections that can help you achieve your financial objectives. By selecting an investment banker who aligns with your goals and understands your industry, you increase the likelihood of a successful partnership.\nKey Questions to Ask Your Investment Banker\nQuestion 1: What is Your Experience in this Industry?\nUnderstanding your investment banker’s experience in your specific industry is essential. Ask about their track record, relevant transactions they’ve handled, and their familiarity with the challenges and opportunities in your industry.\nQuestion 2: Can You Provide Examples of Successful Deals You’ve Closed?\nRequesting examples of successful deals allows you to assess the investment banker’s capabilities and their ability to achieve favorable outcomes. Look for deals similar in scope and complexity to your own to gauge their expertise.\nQuestion 3: How Will You Tailor the Transaction to Fit Our Objectives?\nA successful investment banker will demonstrate the ability to customize their approach to meet your specific goals. Ask how they plan to align the transaction with your objectives and how they will address potential challenges or roadblocks.\nQuestion 4: What is Your Approach to Valuation?\nValuation is a critical aspect of any financial transaction. Inquire about your investment banker’s valuation methodology, their understanding of market trends, and their ability to negotiate favorable terms that align with your financial goals.\nQuestion 5: How Will You Assist in Due Diligence?\nDue diligence is a comprehensive assessment of a target company’s financial, legal, and operational aspects. Ask how your investment banker will support you in conducting due diligence, including their ability to identify potential risks and opportunities, coordinate with other professionals, and provide valuable insights to inform your investment decisions.\nQuestion 6: What is Your Fee Structure?\nUnderstanding the investment banker’s fee structure is crucial to manage your financial expectations. Inquire about their fees, including any upfront costs, success-based fees, or retainer fees. Clarify the scope of services covered by the fees and ensure transparency regarding the overall cost of the engagement.\nQuestion 7: How Will You Ensure Confidentiality and Security?\nMaintaining confidentiality throughout the transaction process is of utmost importance. Ask about the investment banker’s protocols and measures to safeguard sensitive information and ensure data security. Inquire about their experience handling confidential transactions and their commitment to maintaining client privacy.\nReal-Life Scenarios: Businesses Benefit from Asking the Right Questions\n1. XYZ Corporation: XYZ Corporation, a technology company looking to acquire a competitor, engaged an investment banker and asked detailed questions about their experience in the tech industry, successful deals closed, and their approach to valuation.

ABC Healthcare Group: ABC Healthcare Group, a healthcare organization seeking to raise capital for expansion, interviewed multiple investment bankers and asked specific questions about their due diligence capabilities and how they would tailor the transaction to their growth objectives.

While smaller transactions may not require their involvement, complex deals like mergers and acquisitions often benefit from the expertise and network that investment bankers bring.\nHow do I evaluate an investment banker's experience?\nEvaluate an investment banker’s experience by reviewing their track record, industry-specific expertise, and the size and complexity of deals they have successfully closed. Request references from previous clients and conduct thorough due diligence before making a decision.\nCan I negotiate the fee structure with an investment banker?\nThe fee structure is typically negotiable, and it’s important to have open and transparent discussions about fees. Discuss your expectations, the scope of services required, and consider the value and expertise that the investment banker brings to the table.\nWhat confidentiality measures should an investment banker have in place?\nAn investment banker should have strict protocols to ensure confidentiality, including non-disclosure agreements, restricted access to sensitive information, and secure data storage. Inquire about their confidentiality policies and assess their reputation for maintaining client privacy.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, asking the right questions when engaging an investment banker is crucial for successful financial transactions. By understanding their experience, track record, approach to valuation, and ability to tailor the transaction to your objectives, you can make informed decisions and maximize the benefits of the partnership. Remember to clarify fee structures, ensure confidentiality measures, and conduct thorough due diligence before finalizing your engagement.

So logically, the technology firms that understand how to best help other people are the ones who are ultimately going to win the entrepreneurial game. For those of you looking to be the next Facebook or HubSpot, here’s five tips for leveraging your professional network.\n1. Be at the Pulse of Innovation\nTechnology firms are by nature innovators. They are interested in new things. They are not traditionalists. The ability to interact with other companies is priceless when it comes to keeping the mill fresh with new ideas. According to Anupam Satyasheel, Chief Enterprise Officer of\nOccams Advisory\n, being located in an\nNYC coworking space\nwas great for a growing firm. The ability to walk down the hall and get off on another floor and meet people was a tremendous benefit to his startup enterprise. It was educational to listen to them talk about what their companies were doing. And sometimes, he adds, “We found opportunities to tell them about what we do and how it would be relevant to their business.” In addition, Anupam benefited from the flexible approach to business and the realm of office locations that coworking spaces provide. For technology firms whose personnel needs fluctuate with the lifecycle of the product, it’s useful to have the ability to scale up or down, as human capital needs change. The best thing about flexible space is that it is available on-demand and a technology company who has immediate needs won’t have to wait a few weeks or months or go through a lease negotiation.\n2. Get the Best People\nSoftware firms live and die by the strength of their people. Getting the right lineup isn’t an easy task when your human capital needs can fluctuate so drastically from one month to the next depending on where you are in the lifecycle. In the increasingly social media-driven world of today, access to personal information is more public than ever. Add to that the convenience of working in an open-plan office center, and recruiting technology talent is easier. Anupam recalls,”If I think back to 15 or 20 years ago, I had to call a head hunter. It was a long process. These days you can go on LinkedIn or ask somebody in your coworking center and get a qualified referral within a matter of minutes or hours.” A killer strategy would be to combine your networking in a serviced\noffice space in NYC\nwith online recruiting efforts through Facebook or LinkedIn. Do this on an ongoing basis, even when you’re not in hiring mode. Continually being on the prowl for good talent, even when you’re not in the market for anyone, will provide ready access when you’re in a pinch.\n3. Get feedback\nWhat makes software bad or good is the user experience. If people don’t find that the software solves their problems then it will be of no utility to them. However, software that is intuitive, easy to navigate, and contains relevant features will be software that users gobble up. There’s no better way to gauge the user experience than getting direct feedback from a qualified peer group. Sameer Somal of\nBlue Ocean Global Technology\nis a proponent of being surrounded by like-minded people who are growing and investing in their businesses. “In the knowledge worker economy, that nourishes your ability to make better decisions. Instead of climbing the wrong ladder you can ask your peers.” Knowing how your product will be received by a group of potential users is at the core of whether you are going to be successful or not and a huge growth opportunity.\n4. Give\nSoftware companies are built upon relationships, and relationships are ultimately based upon what you are willing to give to other people. According to Sameer, “Like Einstein said, never strive for success; strive to be a person of value. People are smart and they remember when you’ve done more for them than they have done for you.” In any coworking situation, as yourself if you are listening to what other people are saying, and then translating that into an opportunity to give. The best networkers are givers. Reciprocity can be very strong for people who are thought of as kind and nurturing. Always listen with an ear towards how you can help someone as you will foster strong ties with your peers.\n5. Use the Right Jargon\nIf you’re at a standstill in your networking, the words you’re using may be the culprit. For example, the question, “So, what do you do?” seems like an inevitable one in the world of business networking. And it’s ugly. According to Sameer, at the core of the question is a masked demand to explain your value. Awkward, huh? Instead, try questions such as “tell me about the role you have at your firm” or “what are you involved with?” In the same spirit, coming to an event armed with intriguing stories and useful information is a great way to prepare for the awkward silence that inevitably happens at some point when meeting someone new. Study for your networking events beforehand. The time invested will pay dividends in helping to make an uncertain process go smoother. For example, let’s say that you are going to a networking event that focuses on sustainable investing. Read an article or two on the subject, and come up with some insightful questions that potentially could relate back to your software, such as:\nDid you realize that there is over 8 trillion dollars invested in sustainable strategies? I wonder how the accounting software for those investments is structured.\nSo what did you think of the recent Investment News series on\nESG investments\n?\nWhat do you think the next technology innovation in this space will be?\nTell me about your investment fund and what types of sustainable investments options you provide.

Traditional marketing and sales strategies are essential but no longer sufficient on their own. What increasingly separates the successful from the merely operational is a profound, often underestimated force: User Experience (UX).\nFar from just enhancing visual appeal, UX embodies the art of creating experiences that resonate on a human level—experiences that are intuitive, seamless, and profoundly engaging. It’s about understanding and predicting the needs of the user before they are even fully articulated. This is where UX transcends its conventional boundaries and ventures into the strategic, influencing everything from customer loyalty to operational efficiency and competitive differentiation.\nIn this narrative, we explore not just the business value of UX, but its role as a transformative agent in the digital age, illustrated by compelling case studies from brands that have turned UX commitment into substantial profitability.\nThe Essential Role of UX in Shaping Business Success\nToday’s consumers are equipped with more knowledge and higher expectations than ever before. They seek not just service but serendipity—not just function but delight. Their tolerance for inefficiency and poor design is minimal, and their willingness to abandon ship for a better option is high. This shift in consumer behavior makes UX not just important but indispensable.\nConsider UX the silent ambassador of your brand. It communicates your values through interaction rather than proclamation. It builds trust not through promises but through every click, swipe, and tap. Where traditional marketing reaches the mind of the consumer, good UX touches their emotions, builds habits, and fosters loyalty.\nRethinking UX: Beyond Aesthetics to Core Business Strategy\nTo appreciate the profound impact of UX, let’s shift our focus from general benefits to specific, transformative outcomes enabled by strategic UX investments:\n1.\nUX as a Revenue Accelerator:\nTake the case of a financial services firm that reimagined its customer onboarding journey. By simplifying the application process and reducing redundancies, the firm didn’t just enhance user satisfaction—it significantly lifted its conversion rates, demonstrating how UX improvements directly translate to the bottom line.\n2.\nUX as a Brand Differentiator:\nConsider Amazon’s “One-Click” shopping. This feature didn’t just simplify the buying process; it redefined it, setting a new industry standard that others rushed to emulate. Amazon’s UX became its competitive moat, showcasing how innovative UX can carve out market leadership.\nIn-depth Case Studies: The Power of UX Done Right\nAirbnb’s Turnaround with UX:\nWhen Airbnb enhanced its platform’s UX by improving photo quality and streamlining the booking process, it didn’t just improve usability—it transformed user perception and trust, which increased booking rates and helped propel Airbnb to a market leader position.\nApple’s UX Philosophy:\nApple’s consistent focus on clean, intuitive design across its product lines isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about creating a seamless ecosystem that users find indispensable. Apple’s UX practices have not only cultivated an intensely loyal customer base but also allowed it to command premium pricing.\nTo harness the full potential of UX, it must be embedded in the fabric of your business strategy\nInitiate with a UX Audit:\nStart by understanding where your digital touchpoints stand against user expectations and industry benchmarks.\nPrioritize User-Centered Design:\nShift your design philosophy to fully empathize with and anticipate user needs.\nOptimize Continuously:\nUX is not a one-time project but a continuous endeavor that adapts to evolving user behaviors and technological advancements.\nMeasure Impact Rigorously:\nApply metrics to assess how UX enhancements influence user satisfaction, retention, and conversion.\nConclusion\nUX is no longer just a part of the product development process; it is a critical business strategy that demands chief consideration. The future of your business depends on how well you can integrate and elevate the UX of your products and services. As we look ahead, UX will not just support business strategies—it will define them.\nWritten by Shubham Chinchkar, Senior UIUX Designer, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

How do you break through the noise of complex jargon and endless reports to truly captivate your audience?\nThe answer lies in\nmotion graphics.\nThese aren’t just flashy animations or decorative elements. Motion graphics are a storytelling powerhouse—a blend of design, movement, and strategy that can turn the most mundane business concepts into unforgettable visual narratives. In a world of short attention spans and endless scrolling, motion graphics aren’t just helpful—they’re\nessential.\nWhat Are Motion Graphics, really?\nAt their core, motion graphics are “graphics with movement.” Think of them as the digital age’s answer to breathing life into static designs.\nUnlike full-blown animations with elaborate characters and story arcs, motion graphics focus on making\ninformation move\n—bringing text, illustrations, and data to life with seamless animation. Think about the sleek opening credits of a Netflix documentary or the polished explainer videos that break down abstract concepts in seconds. That’s motion graphics in action.\nFor B2B industries, especially financial and professional services, this dynamic medium offers a unique way to:\nSimplify complexity.\nEnhance engagement.\nBuild trust through professional design.\nIt’s not just design—its\ncommunication elevated.\nWhy Motion Graphics Are Revolutionizing B2B Content\nGone are the days when pie charts and spreadsheets were enough to keep your audience engaged. Decision-makers today demand content that is not only\ninformative\nbut also\ninspiring\n. Motion graphics hit that sweet spot.\nHere is why they have become indispensable for B2B industries:\n1. Turning Data into Visual Stories\nFinancial services live and breathe data—but data alone does not tell a story. Motion graphics transform numbers, charts, and statistics into compelling narratives. Picture a bar graph gracefully growing into a skyscraper to represent revenue growth or a timeline unfolding like a road map. Suddenly, your data is not just seen—it is felt.\n2. Grabbing Attention in a World of Noise\nIn the relentless scroll of LinkedIn and Twitter feeds, static visuals often fade into the background. Motion graphics demand attention. They use movement, bold typography, and seamless transitions to pull viewers in and hold their gaze long enough to deliver the message.\n3. Simplifying Complexity\nB2B industries are filled with complexity—regulations, financial models, technical jargon. Motion graphics distill these into digestible, bite-sized visuals. Instead of overwhelming your audience, you engage them with clarity.\n4. Elevating Brand Presence\nA polished motion graphic communicates more than just information—it signals competence and professionalism. By integrating brand colors, typography, and visual elements, motion graphics ensure every piece of content reflects your identity, leaving an impression.\n5. Evoking Emotion Without Faces\nEmotions drive decisions, even in B2B settings. Motion graphics evoke emotions through thoughtful design choices—color psychology, smooth animations, and strategic pacing—allowing you to connect with your audience without relying on human faces.\nThe AI Revolution in Motion Graphics: What’s Trending in 2025\n2025 is ushering in a new era for motion graphics, driven by generative AI tools. These tools are not replacing designers but empowering them to push creative boundaries faster and smarter.\nImagine needing a dozen bespoke icons or a texture that perfectly matches your brand’s aesthetic. Instead of hours spent combing through stock libraries or creating from scratch, tools like\nHere’s how AI is changing the game:\n1. Faster Asset Creation\nGenerative AI tools produce custom assets—icons, shapes, and text boxes—tailored to your project. This eliminates repetitive tasks and frees up designers to focus on storytelling.\n2. Seamless Workflow Integration\nAI does not overshadow creativity; it supercharges it. Tools like Firefly integrate directly into industry staples like Photoshop, blending innovation with familiarity.\n3. Inspiring Creativity\nAI-generated assets can spark fresh ideas, encouraging designers to experiment with styles and concepts they might not have explored otherwise.\nEven global powerhouses like Disney are leveraging AI to craft dynamic visuals. If it’s good enough for the world’s biggest storytellers, why not for your business?\nMotion Graphics in Financial and Professional Services: A Perfect Match\nMotion graphics have always had a home in creative industries, but their value in B2B—particularly in financial and professional services—is now undeniable.\nWhy? Because they tackle the sector’s unique challenges head-on:\nData Overload:\nFrom financial forecasts to compliance reports, the volume of information can be overwhelming. Motion graphics simplify this, turning complexity into clarity.\nAudience Fatigue:\nWhether it is a client pitch or a training module, traditional formats often bore audiences. Motion graphics inject energy, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish.\nPrecision and Professionalism:\nFor industries where trust and accuracy are non-negotiable, motion graphics strike the perfect balance between creativity and professionalism.\nHow Designers Can Lead the Charge?\nAs a motion graphics designer, you are not just an animator—you are a storyteller, strategist, and innovator. Here is how you can establish yourself as a thought leader in the B2B space:\nShowcase Real-World Impact:\nShare case studies that highlight how your designs have helped businesses clarify their message, engage stakeholders, or close deals.\nEducate Your Audience:\nWrite blog posts, create tutorials, or host webinars explaining the benefits of motion graphics for professional services.\nEmbrace Technology:\nStay ahead of the curve by mastering generative AI tools. Share insights and tips to position yourself as an expert in this evolving landscape.\nCollaborate Across Disciplines:\nPartner with professionals in finance, law, or consulting to co-create content that bridges technical expertise with visual storytelling.\nClosing Thoughts: Redefining the Future of B2B Communication\nIn an industry where precision and clarity are paramount, motion graphics offer a rare opportunity to connect with audiences in a way that’s as impactful as it is memorable.\nWhether you’re explaining the intricacies of a financial forecast or pitching a bold new idea, motion graphics are your secret weapon to stand out, inspire, and lead.\nFor motion graphics designers, the future is clear: those who can seamlessly blend creativity with strategy will not only shape the narrative but own it. The stage is set—are you ready to captivate the boardroom and beyond?\nWritten by Abhigyan Srivastava – Motion Graphic Designer, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

These reminders are timely cautions for uninitiated prospects walking into a trap that is likely going to cost them money, time and even reputation. Here is the link to some of these memos and notices.\nhttps://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-renewed-warning-on-employee-retention-credit-claims-false-claims-generate-compliance-risk-for-people-and-businesses-claiming-credit-improperly\nhttps://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-commissioner-signals-new-phase-of-employee-retention-credit-work-with-backlog-eliminated-additional-procedures-will-be-put-in-place-to-deal-with-growing-fraud-risk\nhttps://www.irs.gov/newsroom/employers-watch-out-for-employee-retention-credit-schemes\nOccams Advisory has provided the highest level of compliant\nERC services\nto more than 1,000 clients and has committed to standing behind our work. The quality of work has been appreciated and\napplauded by clients, affiliates and unrelated third parties.\nThe continued and repeated feedback from our clients and affiliates alike is a testimony to the high standards we set and maintain all through the ERC process.\nThe table below helps you quantify and qualify the differences in our practices and the ones that are typically followed by providers and promoters that IRS calls ERC mills. Please understand these differences well and use them in your communication with prospects. Leveraging these you should be able to clearly distinguish Occams Advisory and its market-leading ERC services from other practitioners who might not be as compliant or transparent in their ERC services.\nWarning signs to avoid include\nHow Occams is Different\nA. Unsolicited calls or advertisements mentioning an “easy application process.”\nWe approach you only through your trusted partners (advisors, agents, CPA et al).\nOur application process is clear and extensive, involving dozens of documents and multiple interactions.\nB. Statements that the promoter or company can determine ERC eligibility within minutes.\nIt takes Occams team and its client’s multiple conversations and reviews to identify impacts from government mandates.\nWe also involve independent tax experts and attorneys to ascertain eligibility.\nC. Large upfront fees to claim the credit.\nOur retainers, if applicable, are small and do not even cover our out-of-pocket costs for the process.\nD. Fees based on a percentage of the refund amount of Employee Retention Credit claimed. This is a similar warning sign for average taxpayers, who should always avoid a tax preparer basing their fee on the size of the refund.\nOccams accepts flat fees upon completion of work.\nWe have accepted and are open to accepting alternate methods to estimate our fees.\nE. Preparers seeking anonymity by refusing to sign the ERC return being filed by the business as well as supplying their identifying information and a tax identification number. Similar to “ghost preparers,” this limits the risk to just the taxpayer claiming the credit.\nWe share our names, corporate email, and telephone numbers with all our clients.\nOur website has the names of all the employees who work on various client matters.\nOccams employees connect with prospects and clients on social media.\nF. Aggressive claims from the promoter that the business receiving the solicitation qualifies before any discussion of the group’s tax situation. In reality, the Employee Retention Credit is a complex credit that requires careful review before applying.\nOccams states the eligibility rules clearly to its prospects.\nWe have specific guidance available on our website and through our chatbot available 24×7.\nWe have a high level of expertise on this complex credit and serve our clients with transparency.\nHow the promoters lure victims\nOur Outreach and Sales Process\nA. Aggressive marketing. This can be seen in countless places, including radio, television, social media, online as well as phone calls and text messages.\nAlthough we have a social media and online presence, we connect with prospects primarily through their trusted advisors (CPA’s, wealth managers, trade associations etc.)\nB. Direct mailing. Some ERC mills are sending out fake letters to taxpayers from the non-existent groups like the “Department of Employee Retention Credit.” These letters can be made to look like official IRS correspondence or an official government mailing with language urging immediate action. Some solicitations even make it look like it’s coming from the bank the business uses.\nOccams does not send direct mailers.\nWe always identify ourselves as who we are.\nThere are no misleading emails / letters from us.\nC. Leaving out key details. Third-party promoters of the ERC often don’t accurately explain eligibility requirements or how the credit is computed, and they do not share their workpapers with the businesses claiming the credit. They may make broad arguments suggesting that all employers are eligible without evaluating an employer’s individual circumstances.\nOccams states the eligibility rules clearly to its prospects.\nOccams clearly states that there are specific eligibility criteria that must be met.\nWe deploy market– leading expertise on this complex credit and serve our clients with transparency.\nWe share our work product with clients.\nD. For example, only recovery startup businesses are eligible for the ERC in the fourth quarter of 2021, but promoters fail to explain this limit.\nWe clearly advise clients of the rules regarding which quarters an employer can be eligible for, including the recovery start-up rule.\nE. Also, the promoters may not inform taxpayers that they need to reduce wage deductions claimed on their business’ federal income tax return by the amount of the Employee Retention Credit. This causes a domino effect of tax problems for the business.\nWe advise clients about the tax implication of ERC claims.\nOur agreement states that the ERC claims will lead to the requirement of the client’s amendment of its income tax returns in the years in which ERC is claimed.\nF. Paycheck Protection Program participation. In addition, many of these promoters don’t tell employers that they can’t claim the ERC on wages that were reported as payroll costs to obtain Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness.\nWe advise clients of the PPP funded wages being ineligible for ERC credits.\nWe do not “double dip” in our calculations when we are aware of the client taking PPP.\nG. Mistaken supply chain arguments. Contrary to advice given by unscrupulous preparers, IRS legal guidance in July makes clear that supply chain disruptions do not qualify an employer for the credit unless they are due to a government order. Employers that experienced supply chain disruptions qualify for ERC only if they had to suspend their business operations because their suppliers were unable to provide critical goods or materials due to a government order that caused the supplier to suspend its operations.\nWe have advised clients that supply chain disruptions must be due to governmental orders.\nAn independent attorney will review and opine on any claims of supply chain disruption.\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the\nEmployee Retention Credit (ERC)\nprogram,\nOccams Advisory\nstands as a beacon of trust, guiding clients with transparency, diligence, and unmatched expertise. As the\nIRS warns against fraudulent practitioners\n, Occams Advisory fortifies its commitment to ethical and meticulous service, championing open communication and accurate guidance. Choose a partner dedicated to safeguarding your interests through informed and compliant practices.

From drafting emails to summarizing calls and powering virtual agents, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o are redefining what’s possible in user experiences.\nBut amidst the excitement, a nagging question keeps me up at night:\nAre we solving real problems—or just replacing our users?\nAs a Product Lead working on AI-powered experiences, I’ve seen firsthand how tempting it is to automate aggressively. Yet true product success lies not in replacing human effort, but in augmenting it—amplifying intelligence without sacrificing trust, control, or usability.\nThis post explores what that balance looks like—and how product managers can lead the charge in building AI that truly serves people.\nThe AI Boom and the LLM Temptation\nLLMs like GPT-4o are incredibly capable: they can reason, translate, summarize, answer questions, and even code. With APIs readily available, PMs are under pressure to ship “AI features” fast.\nBut here’s the catch:\n– Users often don’t trust opaque AI decisions.\n– Blind automation introduces usability friction and ethical risks.\n– Hallucinations and unpredictable outputs can tank user confidence.\nJust because the model can do something doesn’t mean it should. And that’s where product thinking becomes critical.\nThe PM’s Role: Capability vs. Experience\nAs PMs, our job isn’t to be AI experts—it’s to make AI useful, usable, and aligned with user intent.\nThat means asking:\n– Is this automation saving effort or creating confusion?\n– Does the user understand what the AI is doing—and why?\n– Can they override it, edit it, or say no?\nThe answers to these questions define whether your AI feature builds trust—or breaks it.\nHuman-Centered AI: Augment, Don’t Replace\nThe most impactful AI products don’t replace humans, they elevate them. They act as intelligent copilots, not autonomous drivers. Here are a few practical principles I’ve adopted:\nTransparency\nExplain what the AI is doing. A suggestion is more trustworthy when users know it’s a suggestion—not a command.\nExample: Showing “Generated by AI” labels with “Edit” options gives users control.\nControl\nLet users opt in, revise, or disable automation. Avoid auto submitting or irreversible actions.\nExample: Auto-drafted emails that can be reviewed, rated, or rewritten.\nContext\nGive users a reason to trust the AI’s output—display sources, rationale, or confidence scores.\nExample: “I summarized this based on your last three meeting notes.”\nFailure Modes\nDesign for imperfections. LLMs will hallucinate or produce irrelevant results. Build fallbacks—not just features.\nExample: If a chatbot can’t answer, offer a human handoff or resource links.\nLLMs Aren’t Just a Feature—They’re a Design Paradigm\nMany teams treat LLMs like a plugin: “Add GPT here.” But LLMs aren’t magic—they require intentional design, tuning, and evaluation.\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\nUse Cases Matter\nDon’t add AI for the sake of it. Focus on workflows where:\n– Users hit friction (e.g., content generation, summarization)\n– Knowledge is fragmented (e.g., search, support)\n– Repetition can be automated (e.g., FAQs, forms)\nUX Patterns That Work Well with LLMs\n– “Suggest + Edit” instead of “Auto-complete everything”\n– Confidence indicators or disclaimers (“AI may be incorrect”)\n– Contextual memory and revisable outputs\nBest Practices for PMs Working with LLMs\nLLMs require a slightly different product development mindset. Here’s a playbook I follow:\n– Always start with the user journey, not the model’s shiny new trick.\n– Prototype relentlessly. Expect weirdness and actively seek out edge cases.\n– Collaborate closely with ML/AI teams, especially around evaluation metrics.\n– Design for fallback states—users should never feel abandoned.\n– Collect feedback at scale—user corrections, downvotes, or skips are gold.\nClosing Thought: Make the User Superhuman\nUltimately, the true promise of AI isn’t about removing the user—it’s about making them superhuman.\nWhether you’re building smart assistants, AI copilots, or intelligent automations, the product goal remains the same: empower people.\nBecause the best AI doesn’t just work—it works with the user.\nLet’s Collaborate\nWhat principles guide your team in building human-centered AI? Share your insights in the comments or reach out directly—I’d love to learn from your experiences!\nBy understanding and strategically applying these trends, I aim to consistently deliver designs that are not only visually compelling but also deeply impactful, driving growth and success for the brands I work with.\nWritten by Sunny Shekhar – Lead – Product Development, Occams Advisory.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

The United States holds the most debt out of any other country, and it continues to grow rapidly. The debt has risen a staggering 122% since 2014 alone. Writer for the Plain Bagel Richard Coffin remarks that “it doesn’t take an economist to recognize that this is a pretty alarming trend.” In perspective, if the national debt were converted to a stack of $1 bills, it would reach the moon and back five times! These alarming statistics have naturally raised concerns that the U.S. could one day default on its debt, which would send shockwaves across the global market and devastate the U.S economy. This whitepaper provides a background and overview of rising concerns over the national debt, repercussions on global markets in the case of the U.S. defaults, and proposed solutions that have been brought up to get the U.S. back on a path of sustainability from a current “fiscal train wreck.”\nRising Concerns Over Debt\nWhile the U.S. has historically never defaulted on its debt, it has come dangerously close to hitting its debt ceiling on several occasions. The debt ceiling is a limit on the total amount of allowable outstanding federal debt and was implemented during World War I to keep the U.S. government fiscally responsible. Since then, however, it’s been raised over 100 times, most recently this January. The Treasury Department has since been taking drastic measures to keep borrowing within its limit to avert the X-date–the day on which the U.S. government is unable to meet all its obligations in full and on time.\nSince the 1980’s, the national debt has risen parabolically. The last surpluses for the U.S government came during fiscal years 1998-2001, at a time when President Bill Clinton worked with a Republican-controlled Congress on a bipartisan budget deal to cut the deficit. Both Democrat and Republican administrations have added significantly to the federal deficit and debt to achieve their respective policy visions. Obama’s Affordable Care and U.S Recovery and Reinvestment Act cost hundreds of billions of dollars each. Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, defense spending, and costly COVID relief also soared the federal debt. The average national debt every U.S. citizen owes is $100,000, showing that the debt is not just an elusive figure on a screen but a scary reality to reckon with.\nDomestic/Global Impacts of a U.S Default\nThe domestic effects of the U.S. defaulting on debt would be catastrophic. The U.S. bond market, used as the primary form of collateral in the global financial system, would become instantly unstable as interest rates would spike on U.S. bonds, which in turn would spike general interest rates for mortgages, credit cards, loans, government bonds, etc. This would trigger a recession as businesses, particularly those with contracts with the government, would have a hard time operating. The unemployment rate would sharply increase from 3.4% to 7%. This time, unlike during the Great Depression and COVID-19, the U.S. government with inadequate cash would be unable to aid consumers and businesses. Moody projects that a U.S. default would wipe out 6 million jobs and $15 trillion in wealth. Additionally, The U.S government’s credit rating would expectedly downgrade, making it harder to borrow money from abroad. As a result, the U.S. government would be left with no choice but to heavily reduce spending through cutting key programs in military, healthcare, Social Security, etc.\nA default would also send shockwaves to global markets. As the famous saying goes, “When the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.” Demand for volatile U.S. treasuries would sink as panicked investors would sell off their holdings. In turn, the U.S. dollar would crash and likely be abandoned as the world reserve currency, which would hurt global financial markets reliant on the dollar. According to the researchers at The Federal Reserve, between 1999 to 2019, U.S. dollars accounted for 96% percent of trade in the U. S, 74% in Asia, and 79% in Europe. A U.S. dollar crash would trigger a global recession as prices of global stocks go down, inflationary pressures rise, and foreign countries’ export revenues fall precipitously as U.S consumers’ purchasing power erodes and they buy fewer international products.\nInception of DOGE\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has formally announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to be headed by billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. DOGE’s function is to balance the budget by eliminating wasteful government spending and eliminating $2 trillion from the national debt. While it is not exactly clear how Musk and Ramaswamy plan to do this, the general idea is to improve the efficiency of the U.Sn government by removing agencies that overlap with others in function. This is intended to reduce the running cost of the government and “slash and burn bureaucracy” according to Ramaswamy. While the effectiveness of Trump’s DOGE in achieving fiscal responsibility remains to be seen, the creation of such a program marks an unprecedented step of the executive branch taking sweeping measures to address the national debt problem.\nConclusion\nThe critical issue that the U.S. faces is not just the current debt it has but the unsustainable path at which it is heading. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that it would take nearly $8 trillion of budget cuts to keep the debt from growing faster than the economy over the long term. While ideas like inflating away the debt, implementing a national sales tax, and increasing legal immigration could theoretically work, the U.S.’s most realistic option would be to reduce its deficit by balancing the budget in the long term. At least for the next two years, it is up to a Republican-controlled Congress and White House to choose how much attention to heed to this crisis. It will be interesting to see how much debt on top of $36 trillion will be added in the next 4 years and if the country will be able to keep up any longer.\nWritten by Veer Agarwal\nVeer Agarwal studies at Livingston High School in the United States.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

That is the aspect that builds confidence in the investor's eyes.\nPaparella has more than 20 years of expertise in investment management, development of strategies and M&A, as well as middle-market and big cap enterprise capital raising.\n\"Investors want to know the purpose and use of those funds with a fair amount of precision,\" Paparella says. \"That will help determine whether it is the type of investment that will provide an acceptable return or not.\"\nSmart Market Dealmakers speak to Paparella in this Dealmaker Q&A about the three things any investor needs to hear before offering funding and what to think if you're leery about giving up your company's equity.\nBefore trying to collect money, what do businesses understand ?\nWhen thinking about making an investment, there are three characteristics that any investor can look for. If it's a capital raising or someone seeking to sell the business, this is real.\nThey will evaluate the consistency, scope and breadth of the leadership team. They will analyse the company's previous financial results or the potential whether there is a fund raising for a start-up to see the company's expected financial output. The third element is the potential for growth that the business provides.\nThese are not only the three most important points to remember, but they are also potentially the most important ones in that order.\nInvestors will almost often aim to analyse the management team so they invest in the team rather than an idea or a company. Many businesses do not have a well-defined three-year growth plan, whether it is a start-up or an organisation that has been in business for decades, where they can articulate how the corporation, the markets, geographies, goods and services and consumer categories can continue to expand. It is very important to be able to nail the plan on a capital raise for a startup. It is something that brings value to the company while you are selling the company. At the end of the tunnel, it encourages investors to see the light of how the business can get from where they are now and where the investor needs to move them in the future.\nHow do you know the amount of money that you need ?\nThe quantity you need is contingent on the target. The issue with spending more than you need is that you're going to give away more resources than you need. Usually, if you don't lift enough and still require some, it's not a question. When you can make improvements, the business gets more profitable as you make progress. Therefore you're giving up less equity for the same dollar sum. If the organisation has not done as it said it will on the initial capital raising round the possible risk of not raising enough capital may become more difficult to eventually raise the capital you need. That's undoubtedly a juggling act.\nIt's both science and art. The science part is that you start with a three-year plan and then layer in a\nfinancial model\nthat reflects the strategy to classify all the expense components and scale it for development to decide what you think the need is going to be. The art aspect of it is where you take a step back and just look at it from a gut instinct and see if it makes sense. You will decide at that point that you do not need as much as you thought, so you see in your financial model that you can probably hit a cash flow generating point in month 18 that will self-fund for the remaining 18 months everything you need. So you do not need 36 months of money.\nWhat if it scares you for selling equity ?\nYou can also be profitable if you don't raise the money and may be able to accumulate the amount of financing you need steadily, making strides before you get to the point that the business will self-fund. You don't give up much equity in that situation and you remain in charge of the company. That's presumably the way to go if that's important to you. The bad part is you're not going to evolve as easily. You face potential competition that could be avoided by business speed.\nYou're in the market easier if you collect a lot of money upfront and you offer up any of a lot of equity for that capital. You have a greater chance of growth and a greater likelihood of being a bigger organisation than you will achieve on your own. You have more money and you have outside experience that comes from institutional investors for that capital. Personal choice and\nrisk aversion\nreally boils down to it.\n#RaisingCapital #SellingEquity #InvestmentManagement #SignetCapitalAdvisors\nArticle Credits –\nsmartbusinessdealmakers.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nNavigating the Tax Maze: A Comprehensive Guide to Tax Effici...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Case Studies  Real-Life Scenarios  Frequently Asked Questions Conclusion  Sources and Citations Introduction In the dynamic and often intricate world...\nRead More\nMerger Integration Challenges & How to Overcome Them in the...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Case Studies Real-Life Scenarios How Occams Advisory Can Help FAQ's Conclusion Citations/SourcesIntroduction Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can be a...\nRead More\nTax & Operational Efficiency Solutions | Occams Advisory - C...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Real-Life Scenarios FAQ's Conclusion Citations/SourcesTax & Operational Efficiency: A Guide by Occams Advisory   Introduction In the competitive worl...\nRead More",

For businesses operating in the United States, navigating the complexities of the tax code can be a daunting task. However, by adopting a proactive approach to tax efficiency planning, businesses can effectively manage their tax obligations, minimize their tax burden, and maximize their after-tax returns.\nTax efficiency planning involves a comprehensive assessment of a company’s financial situation, business structure, and projected growth trajectory. By carefully analyzing income, expenses, deductions, and credits, businesses can identify opportunities to reduce their tax liability and enhance their bottom line.\nAt Occams Advisory, we understand the complexities of tax efficiency planning and are committed to helping businesses navigate the tax maze and achieve their financial goals. Our team of experienced tax professionals provides tailored advice, helps businesses stay abreast of tax law changes, and ensures that businesses are maximizing their tax savings opportunities.\nReal-Life Case Studies: Tax Efficiency in Action\nTo illustrate the impact of effective tax efficiency planning, let’s consider two real-life case studies:\nCase Study 1: Strategic Timing of Income and Expenses\nA manufacturing company historically recognized income in the fourth quarter of the year, leading to a significant tax liability. By implementing a strategy to defer income recognition to the first quarter of the following year, the company effectively reduced its tax liability for the current year. Occams’ team of experts guided the company through this strategic transition, ensuring compliance and maximizing tax savings.\nCase Study 2: Maximizing Tax Deductions and Credits\nA technology company was unaware of the research and development credit, which directly offset its tax liability. Occams’ tax professionals conducted a thorough analysis of the company’s research and development activities, meticulously documenting them to claim substantial tax savings. By leveraging Occams’ expertise, the company was able to significantly reduce its tax burden and increase its after-tax returns.\nFAQs\nHow can my business structure impact my tax liability?\nThe legal structure of a business, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, can have significant tax implications. Businesses should carefully evaluate their options and choose the structure that best aligns with their financial goals and tax profile. Occams’ tax professionals can provide comprehensive guidance on selecting the optimal business structure for your specific needs.\nWhat are some common tax deductions and credits that businesses can utilize?\nCommon deductions include expenses for business operations, depreciation of assets, and employee benefits. Credits, such as the research and development credit, can directly offset tax liability. Occams’ tax experts stay up to date on the latest tax laws and regulations, ensuring that you are aware of all available deductions and credits.\nHow can I stay informed about tax law changes?\nRegularly reviewing tax updates and consulting with tax professionals can help ensure compliance and identify potential planning opportunities. Occams Advisory provides ongoing tax updates and consultations to help you stay informed and make informed decisions about your business’s tax strategies.\nConclusions: The Enduring Value of Tax Efficiency Planning\nTax efficiency planning is an ongoing process that requires continuous evaluation and adaptation to changing tax laws and business circumstances. By proactively managing their tax obligations with Occams’ expert guidance, businesses can gain a competitive advantage, enhance their financial performance, and achieve their long-term goals.\nSources and Citations\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS):\nhttps://www.irs.gov/\nTax Foundation:\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce:\nhttps://www.uschamber.com/\nSmall Business Administration (SBA):\nhttps://www.sba.gov/\nBloomberg Tax:\nhttps://pro.bloombergtax.com/\nBDO USA:\nhttps://www.bdo.com/\nAICPA & CIMA:\nhttps://www.aicpa-cima.com/\nOccams Advisory:\nhttps://occamsadvisory.com/\nRelated Topic Blog\nAccounting Firm Innovations as a Route to Growth\nBusinesses are continuously seeking to develop in the face of increased market competition.

This isn’t just a passing trend—it’s a profound shift in how we communicate, design, and connect. Especially in B2B industries like financial and professional services, where trust and clarity are the currency of success, the Quiet Revolution is transforming the way we engage with clients and stakeholders.\nSo, what makes silence such a powerful creative tool? And how can we, as leaders in design, use it to shape the future of B2B communication? Let’s explore.\nDrowning in Noise: The Modern Content Problem\nPicture this:\nA LinkedIn feed overflowing with thought leadership posts, inboxes bombarded with sales emails, client presentations crammed with charts, graphs, and jargon. The average decision-maker sees up to\n10,000 ads daily\nand spends just a few seconds skimming each one before moving on.\nThis relentless deluge creates not only fatigue but a dangerous kind of desensitization. When everything is loud, flashy, and busy, nothing truly stands out.\nEnter silence: not the absence of communication, but the deliberate act of simplifying it. Silence cuts through the chaos, offering a moment of stillness that commands attention. It’s a breath of fresh air in a room that’s been suffocating for far too long.\nSilence Is More Than Absence\nSilence isn’t simply about muting noise; it’s about designing moments that pause, resonate, and linger. It’s an active, deliberate choice—a commitment to prioritize clarity and connection over clutter. Here’s how silence shows up in B2B design and communication:\n1. Negative Space: The Power of What’s Not There\nIn design, what you leave out is often as important as what you put in. Negative space (or whitespace) isn’t just “empty”—it’s the stage where your message takes the spotlight.\nThink of a financial dashboard or a corporate presentation. Overcrowding it with data, charts, and explanations can overwhelm the audience. Strategic use of negative space, however, directs attention, highlights key insights, and makes complex information digestible.\n2. Muted Colors: A Palette That Speaks Confidence\nIn industries where decisions carry weight and risks are high, loud visuals can feel jarring. A muted, intentional color palette—a mix of soft greys, earthy tones, or neutral hues—projects calm authority. It says, “We’re here to guide, not overwhelm.”\n3. Auditory Stillness: The Sound of Focus\nIn video content, webinars, or presentations, silence can amplify what’s important. IKEA’s “Silence of Sleep” campaign, for example, used tranquil, wordless scenes to create a sense of calm. In a B2B context, imagine a product video that lets visuals and moments of quiet speak louder than words or music. Silence can give the audience space to think, reflect, and absorb your message.\nWhy Does Silence Work So Well?\nSilence isn’t a gimmick; it’s rooted in psychology and human behavior. Here’s why it’s so powerful in the B2B space:\n1. It Encourages Reflection\nIn B2B, you’re not selling a soda or a pair of sneakers—you’re offering solutions that impact businesses, livelihoods, and futures. These are decisions that require thought, deliberation, and trust. Silence gives your audience the breathing room to engage deeply with your message instead of skimming past it.\n2. It Captures Attention\nImagine a crowded room where everyone is shouting. Then, one person speaks in a calm, measured voice—or doesn’t speak at all. Who do you notice? Silence has the paradoxical effect of cutting through the noise. It draws attention precisely because it’s unexpected and rare.\n3. It Simplifies Complexity\nB2B often involves explaining complex ideas—financial strategies, legal services, technological solutions. By stripping away distractions and allowing the core message to breathe, silence sharpens clarity and builds understanding. It lets your audience focus on what truly matters.\nReal-World Examples of Silence in Action\n1. Netflix’s Screensavers\nOn idle screens, Netflix displays serene, moving visuals without sound or commentary. These aren’t just placeholders—they invite curiosity and exploration. Imagine applying this principle to a B2B dashboard or report interface: data presented elegantly, with simplicity, inspiring the user to explore further.\n2. Muji’s Minimalism\nMuji’s no-logo, no-clutter philosophy is a masterclass in using less to say more. For B2B brands, this could mean creating presentations, reports, and marketing materials that focus on clarity and substance, rather than overwhelming design.\n3. The Rise of ASMR\nASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) ads are designed to engage the senses quietly and intimately. This trend teaches us the power of subtlety. In B2B, think of videos or presentations that use ambient sounds or moments of pause to create a sensory, memorable experience.\nHow to Bring Silence into Your B2B Creative Strategy\n1. Design for Focus\nDeclutter.\nUse negative space to guide the eye to what’s important—whether it’s a key insight in a financial report or a call-to-action in a marketing campaign.\n2. Pause with Purpose\nIn storytelling, pauses are as important as words. In a webinar or video, allow moments of stillness to build anticipation or emphasize a key message. Silence can be suspenseful and thought-provoking.\n3. Be Intentional with Sound\nSound doesn’t have to fill every second. The absence of sound can create contrast, focus attention, and highlight transitions. Consider using silence as a punctuation mark in your next client presentation.\nThe Future Is Quiet\nIn B2B, trust is built through clarity, authenticity, and respect for your audience’s time and attention. Silence isn’t just a creative tool; it’s a philosophy. It’s about stripping away the unnecessary to reveal what’s essential.\nAs leaders in design, we have a choice: we can join the noise, or we can create work that resonates. By embracing the principles of the Quiet Revolution, we not only stand out in crowded spaces but forge deeper, more meaningful connections with our clients and stakeholders.\nSo, the next time you’re crafting a pitch, designing a campaign, or delivering a message, ask yourself:\nWhere can I let silence speak?\nIn a world that never stops shouting, the boldest thing you can do is whisper.\nWritten by Zidane Zafar – Assistant Creative Director, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

This sweeping legislation made several tax provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and included significant changes that directly benefit Qualified Small Businesses (QSBs). While it may seem like SMEs have much to gain from the legislation, they must remain vigilant about certain provisions, such as cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, as well as rising borrowing costs driven by a $3 trillion surge in the federal deficit that could harm their bottom lines. This whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges the OBBBA presents to SMEs, offering the insights you need to guide your business forward strategically. While the OBBBA provides momentary tax relief, SMEs must anchor their planning not in political cycles, but in long-term economic resilience. At Occams, we guide businesses to think beyond election-year economics through output-focused solutions.\n\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act presents both opportunities and headwinds for small and medium enterprises. While the immediate tax benefits are welcome, our clients need to look beyond the short-term relief and build strategies that can weather policy changes and economic cycles. At Occams, we help businesses focus on what they can control, operational efficiency, cash flow\nmanagement, and sustainable growth, rather than betting their future on any single piece of legislation.\"\nBenefits\nOBBBA includes several tax relief provisions designed to ease financial and operational challenges faced by small business owners. Key benefits include:\nQualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction\nA key feature of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the QBI deduction is now permanent. This allows eligible owners of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and certain trusts, to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income from taxable earnings. Making this deduction permanent provides small business owners with greater certainty in their tax planning and protection against future tax increases.\nFull Deduction for R&D Expenses\nStarting in 2025, businesses can deduct the full cost of domestic research and development (R&D) expenses in the year they are incurred, replacing the previous requirement to spread these deductions over five years. Small businesses with average annual gross receipts under $31 million may also apply this provision retroactively to R&D expenses incurred after December 31, 2021, allowing them to amend prior tax returns for potential refunds.\nPermanent 100% Bonus Depreciation\nThe bill makes permanent the ability to deduct 100% of the cost of qualified property, such as machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, and certain interior improvements, in the year of purchase. This supports faster reinvestment and improves cash flow by reducing upfront tax liabilities.\nTemporary Full Expensing for Qualified Production Property\nA temporary provision permits full expensing of certain nonresidential real estate used directly in production-related activities like manufacturing. Specific rules apply regarding property acquisition and use, and leased properties or spaces not directly tied to production are excluded. Should the use of the property change within 10 years, a recapture rule will apply.\nSection 179 Expensing Expansion\nFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, the bill increases both the maximum deduction limit and the phase-out threshold for Section 179 expensing. This allows businesses to immediately deduct the entire cost of eligible tangible personal property, including computers, tools, and certain vehicles, instead of depreciating those assets over several years.\nChallenges\nWhile OBBBA provides certain tax relief benefits, the bill includes several provisions small business owners cannot afford to ignore:\nIncreased Borrowing Costs\nThe bill is projected to add more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. As a result, inflationary pressure and interest rates are likely to rise, making it harder for small businesses to obtain affordable capital. For those already facing tight margins or relying on credit to grow, these rising borrowing costs will pose a significant obstacle.\nReductions to Healthcare Access\nThe legislation significantly cuts Medicaid funding and tightens eligibility criteria, which could result in many small-business owners and their workers losing healthcare coverage. In addition, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that help reduce premium costs for marketplace plans are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. These changes may lead to higher healthcare expenses, adding financial strain and complicating efforts to recruit and retain employees in a competitive labor market.\n“These cuts put pressure on already strained budgets and make it harder for small businesses to recruit and retain talent in a tight labor market,” said Carolyn Rodz, co-founder and CEO of Hello Alice, an online small-business resource platform.\nReduced Funding for the CFPB\nThe bill also cuts the annual budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by nearly half. Although often associated with consumer advocacy, the CFPB also supports small businesses by promoting transparency in financial services and combating unfair lending practices. The reduction in funding will constrain the agency’s ability to carry out its full regulatory responsibilities, leaving small-business owners more exposed to deceptive or predatory financial products. “Weakening the CFPB leaves small-business owners vulnerable to predatory lenders and scams,” said Heidi Pickman, vice president of engagement and external relations at CAMEO Network.\nConclusion\nOn the surface, the OBBBA includes many provisions that appear beneficial to SMEs. However, its broader effects, such as rising borrowing costs and increased healthcare expenses, could disproportionately harm small business owners who rely on affordable capital and relief from crushing healthcare costs. Although many of these changes won’t take effect immediately, it’s essential to start planning ahead.\nThrough services like tax strategy sessions and legislative impact analysis, Occams Advisory is committed to fortifying the foundation of your business. We don’t just respond to legislation; we anticipate and strategize around it, ensuring your business stays ahead, not just afloat.

In an industry where precision and strategy drive everything we do, the habits we cultivate in our personal lives directly influence our professional success. It’s not just about delivering for clients – it’s about showing up as the best version of ourselves every day.\nThese 12 small but powerful tweaks have shaped how I lead and perform. They’re not tied to a calendar or a checklist; they’re habits that, when implemented consistently, can transform how you work, think, and live.\nStart with Energy\nThe foundation of a productive day is how you begin it. A healthy breakfast may seem simple, but it’s a game-changer. Fueling your body with something like Greek yogurt and berries or eggs on whole-grain toast provides the energy and clarity needed for strategic decision-making. In our industry, where mental sharpness is paramount, this is non-negotiable.\nRef:\nhttps://www.ahealthiermichigan.org/stories/food-and-recipes/the-morning-meals-impact-on-productivity\nIntegrate Movement\nLeadership often demands back-to-back meetings, but who says they all have to be in a boardroom? Walking meetings are an excellent way to break the monotony, boost creativity, and foster deeper connections. Some of my best ideas have come while walking with a colleague or client. It’s a reminder that movement isn’t just physical – it stimulates new ways of thinking.\nRef:\nhttps://news.stanford.edu/stories/2014/04/walking-vs-sitting-042414\nReframe with Gratitude\nThe financial advisory world can be stressful, with constant demands and high-stakes decisions. Practicing daily gratitude helps keep things in perspective. Taking five minutes at the end of each day to note what went well – big or small – creates a mindset that focuses on progress over problems. Gratitude doesn’t just make you feel better; it sharpens your ability to recognize opportunities.\nRef:\nhttps://www.happify.com/hd/the-science-behind-gratitude/\nMaster Focus\nWe live in a world of constant interruptions, and in our line of work, those distractions can derail critical thinking. Dedicate specific blocks of time each day to “deep work” by silencing notifications and prioritizing tasks that demand your best thinking. This simple practice improves efficiency and ensures you’re operating at your peak when it matters most.\nRef: Cal Newport “Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World”\nPrioritize Physical Well-being\nLeadership is as much physical as it is mental. Starting the day with a short stretching routine enhances circulation, reduces stress, and sets the tone for mindful movement throughout the day. In a role that often requires long hours at a desk, this small habit creates balance and clarity.\nStay Hydrated for Sharp Thinking\nThe demands of advisory work can lead to long hours without proper hydration. Yet, something as simple as drinking enough water significantly impacts energy levels and cognitive performance. Keeping a water bottle within reach ensures that you’re always operating with clarity, even during the most intense days.\nRef:\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908954/\nInvest in Knowledge\nContinuous learning is essential for leaders in a fast-evolving field like financial services. Dedicating just 10 minutes a day to reading – whether it’s a leadership book or industry analysis keeps your mind sharp and your strategies innovative. This habit not only fuels professional growth but also provides a mental pause to recharge.\nOptimize Midday Fuel\nIn the rush of meetings and deadlines, lunch often becomes an afterthought. Preparing healthy, balanced lunches ahead of time ensures you’re not just grabbing something convenient but fueling your body and mind for sustained performance. This simple tweak also reinforces discipline and structure in a chaotic schedule.\nRef:\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.4278/0890-1171-3.2.12\nListen with Intention\nFinancial advisory isn’t just about offering solutions; it’s about understanding what clients and colleagues truly need. Active listening – being fully present, reflecting back what you hear, and asking thoughtful questions – builds trust and uncovers opportunities that others might miss. It’s one of the most overlooked yet transformative leadership habits.\nPause for Reflection\nIn a field driven by constant progress, it’s easy to move from one task to the next without pausing. Regularly taking 15 minutes to reflect on recent successes and areas for improvement enhances self-awareness and adaptability. Reflection isn’t just about looking back – it’s about refining how you move forward.\nDisconnect to Reconnect\nLeadership requires clarity, and sometimes that means stepping away. Setting aside one evening a week for a digital detox – no emails, no screens – allows you to reconnect with yourself, your loved ones, or even a good book. This intentional pause improves focus and fosters the mental clarity needed to make better decisions.\nCelebrate Your Progress\nIn our industry, we often focus on the next target, the next milestone. But recognizing your achievements – both big and small – reinforces motivation and sets a positive tone for future goals. Whether it’s sharing progress with a mentor, treating yourself, or simply reflecting on your growth, celebrating wins creates a sense of fulfillment that fuels long-term success.\nWhy These Tweaks Matter\nAs the Deputy CEO of Occams Advisory, I’ve seen firsthand how small, intentional changes can elevate leadership and drive better results. These habits aren’t just about personal improvement; they’re about showing up more effectively for your clients, your team, and yourself.\nTransformation doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Start with one tweak, make it part of your routine, and build from there. The compounding effect of these habits will lead to a 2025 where you’re not just thriving professionally but living with purpose and balance.\nYour next step is simple: choose one habit and start today.\nWritten by\nDavid King, Deputy CEO, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Magazine’s Best Workplaces in America 2025\nTrump’s Semiannual Earnings Proposal Gets SEC Backing – Strategic Insights from Anupam Satyasheel\nOccams Advisory Achieves 9th Inc. 5000 Honor, Ranks No. 798 in 2025\nArchives\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\nBrand Promotion during the Covid Outbreak\nOct 01 2020 |\nOccams Marketing\n141\n0\nIn periods of crisis, advertisers can find it difficult to know where to start. People have gone into security mode in just a few short weeks, concentrating on themselves, their friends, their workers, their clients, and their neighbourhoods. This is mirrored by social media, with calls for fellow people to follow protocols for government protection. To build bridges within their neighbourhoods and cultures and unify against an unseen power, people have crossed political lines.\nWith social distance holding many individuals at home, we are already witnessing substantial improvements in behavioural patterns. For reliable information, customers have returned to broadcast and cable television and other premium media outlets. They also aim to download gaming software, spend still more time on social media, and watch more movies and scripted content in the way of escapism and entertainment. And we are testing the bandwidth of our homes in a predominantly pre-5 G environment between immersive working arrangements and live-streamed exercise courses, college seminars, and social engagements.\nThe need for physical products, meanwhile, is putting pressure on new outlets, with e-commerce growth rising to new standards. Grocery and convenience stores are the centre of basics for those who do go out, but availability is sporadic. Health and safety issues are pushing more consumers, such as using cell phones to pay at check-out without touching a screen or stylus, towards frictionless payment systems.\nAny of these changes in behaviour can be intermittent, but many may be more lasting. If people step past the existing paradigm of survival, it is impossible that the impetus behind the acceptance of digital interactions will change if people are compelled to do new stuff through circumstances. During this tough moment, with so much changing very rapidly, what steps should brands take to represent and expand their client ele, minimise harm, and take care of their people?\nPresent with honesty and empathy\nPeople right now feel insecure. Empathy is pivotal. For starters, many banks have moved to forgive overdraft fees, acknowledging their customers' struggles. SAP has made the Qualtrics Remote Job Pulse platform open to firms who could be moving quickly to new ways of working. In the presence of a power greater than any of us, those instances display modesty.\nThe complexities of the voice of the company are more responsive than ever. It would not do well with brands that use this period to be financially exploitative. Best to do as Guinness did in the St. Patrick's Day timeframe, as the brand moved its attention away from parties and pub events and leaning towards a sustainability and well-being campaign instead. We may not have all the solutions at these times, and we need to accept that. You have to be able to deliver on what you say if you make pledges, even during unpredictable periods.\nUsing media in areas that are more responsive\nMarketers would try to create more\nrapid-response operational models\ninternally and through organisations to pivot innovative communications rapidly as conditions shift. As the crisis progresses, access to remote output and innovative resources will become increasingly necessary. For starters, Nike quickly moved to embrace a new message: \"Play inside, play for the world.\" And Chiquita Brands stripped Miss Chiquita from their emblem in order to facilitate social distancing and demonstrate a commitment to public safety. \"I'm home now. Please do the same to defend yourself, \"the caption on Instagram reads.\"\nBeyond innovation, as the mixture of different media channels used by customers evolves increasingly, advertisers should consider changing their advertising mix. Marketers may choose to amplify their use of ad-supported premium video content and smartphone games, for example, with interactive content spiking. Similarly, considering the degree of interaction and importance, when news consumption increases as buyers jostle to keep updated, companies need not fear the adjacency. News may clearly be an area that needs more careful control of how much content tends to eliminate over-exposure to innovation, which can damage brand value.\nAssociate with nice the brand\nIn a time of crisis, people would recall brands for their acts of good, particularly if done with true heart and goodness. This might take the form of contributing to food banks, giving emergency staff free items, or continuing to pay workers while the doors of the organisation are closed. For starters, Adobe made Creative Cloud open to K-12 organisations automatically, recognising that this was a moment to offer rather than being strictly commercial. Consumers are likely to know how Ford, GE, and 3 M collaborated to repurpose production ability and bring people back to work to combat coronavirus by producing respirators and ventilators. And people admire that many alcoholic beverage firms have repurposed their alcohol processing capacities from Diageo to AB InBev to produce hand sanitizer, softening short stocks with their slogan \"It's in our hands to make a difference.\"\nTo boost the brand, feel-good content that alleviates fear and encourages constructive advertising can go a long way. Companies ought to illustrate, however, that their donations are material and not for financial gain alone. Authenticity and real intent are known by customers.\nTrack patterns and build scenarios\nIn real time , regular examination of\nhuman behavioural patterns\ncan assist advertisers to obtain deeper insights. To help adapt content, advertisers may want to measure opinion and usage patterns on a daily basis, carefully track the dialogue through social media channels, online forums, and e-commerce product pages to scan out openings and more rapidly recognise imminent emergencies. To power the right decisions, businesses should consider rapidly developing dashboards for this sort of data.\nIn order to offer insights to executives who are progressively concerned with marketing decisions, marketers may also want to explore developing deeper relations with their C-suite colleagues. Based for how long the situation lasts, the communications director can work closely with finance and management to predict multiple situations and future effects.\nAdjust to new ways of operating in order to continue producing\nHow rapidly many firms have been able to move to remote working practises is promising. The integration of collaborative technology will include chat, file sharing, meeting and call capabilities effortlessly, allowing teams to stay linked and stay efficient. Digital happy hours are now emerging as the latest trend for the development of team morale. Partners are \"pitching\" remotely, recognising that for weeks to come, an in-face sales call is unlikely to occur. Leaders have to do their utmost to change every aspect of the operating model to this new paradigm, from promotion, to distribution, to operation. Out of our present frustration, new forms of creativity and even margin enhancement will arise.\nHow do we prepare for the future and beyond?\nWe are in the admit-and-adapt process of the pandemic of Covid-19. But after the disaster, we have to prepare for life as well. Marketing executives must strive strategically to make their products and consumer experiences as complete as possible, while working internally to do three things while we manage what we know:\nUnderstand the influence of organisation instability and prepare to assess the unforeseen.\nLean into digital ways of communicating with clients and interacting with them, recognising that this is going to have enduring consequences.\nMitigate risks to the consumer experience by working through the outside-in in a practical manner.\nThere is, undeniably, a forced acceleration of the policy of digital change as we realise how rapidly clients and workers have adopted technologically connected journeys and experiences.\nDuring these unpredictable and unparalleled conditions, companies must all think, work, and lead in new ways, and we will all have to learn in both faith and modesty.\nArticle Credits -\nhbr.org\n#BrandPromotion #Coronavirus #Crisis #5GWorld #WFH\nRelated Topic Blog\nWhat M&A after the pandemic feels like ?\nIs the pandemic of the coronavirus and the corresponding economic crisis a time to postpone or seek acquisitions?

That data is more important than just having a little bit of trivia. That means that for brands and companies, it's enough time every day for you to grab your audience via smartphone.\nThe bottom line is, if you want to raise the bottom line of your brand or boost customer loyalty, then mobile marketing MUST be included in your\nonline marketing plan\n. If not, you're missing out on a simple chance for your audience to join.\nIn this post, I'm going to show you how mobile marketing is used by some of the most popular brands to draw clients and develop their business, and how you can use these same tactics to create your own brand.\nWhat is advertisement from smartphone devices and why does it matter?\nQuite simply, through apps, social media channels, and websites , mobile marketing is the promotion of a brand or business in a way that is tailored for smartphones and other mobile devices.\nAlthough we understand that many customers spend many hours on their laptops, 59% report they spend their spare time on mobile devices, advertisers have been reluctant to respond to this technology. On average, advertisers spend just 15% of their budgets on handheld applications and the remaining 85% on desktop devices. Since smartphone ads have better penetration rates than desktops, which are around 64 percent higher than typical desktop conversions, this makes little sense.\nSearch engines have not, although advertisers have dropped the ball on implementing more mobile-friendly content tactics. That means mobile marketing is becoming more and more relevant for SEO as well. In 2016 , Google revealed that, based on how optimised they are for smartphones, they will begin indexing business and brand websites.\nIf you want to score high on Google for your brand blogs, then pages need to be posted easily, buttons (calls-to-action) need to function on touch screens, and photos need to be scaled appropriately on smaller screens, all to fit smartphone users.\nBasically, if the website of your brand is not mobile optimised first to look good and perform well on a mobile device, then it will be useless for any marketing strategy you implement. If a prospective buyer clicks on a connexion on their mobile device in a social media ad, email, or text message and they are led to a mobile page that does not function well, so they will automatically click away from it and you will miss that potential transaction.\nNot only does your website have to be mobile-ready, but with the mobile user interface in mind, the material for your ads still has to be developed. Content needs to be simple, easy to interpret, easy to absorb, and needs to draw the interest of someone on their phone who scrolls away easily. Your commercials have a relatively small window of time to attract and hold the customer interested.\n6 Smartphone Brand Awareness Building Tactics\nIf the aim of your campaign is to create brand awareness, mobile marketing would be a major part of every marketing plan. Mobile-friendly outlets such as social media applications make it easier for users, whether they want, comment or share, to engage with brands, making them perfect ways to start brand awareness campaigns.\nHere are a few methods you can use to create brand recognition using mobile devices.\nMobile Announcements\nA perfect way to communicate with the intended audience of your company and improve retention rates is to give smartphone users text updates about coupons, deals, offers, etc. Give a text subscription on your website to your followers / customers, something along the lines of, \"Enter your phone number to receive text announcements of exclusive sales, deals, or activities.\"\nCode of QR\nBy manufacturing smartphone barcodes (QR codes) or electronic coupons that can be physically checked at the point of purchase while consumers visit the company in-store, many brands have achieved success. To allow them access to a sale or promotional deal, these QR codes may be emailed to the customer. Similarly, in-store QR codes that allow clients to register for a contest or special giveaway when scanned may be made available.\nMobile Marketing for Friendly Email\nEmail marketing\nis an extremely powerful way to keep your clients or fans in touch. Make sure all links found in the email are clickable and engaging to make the email marketing more mobile-friendly. Email marketing connexions are a perfect way to transfer clients from the email to the website of your brand to better turn a client contact into a deal.\nMarketing SMS\nSMS Marketing is a perfect way for the brand to connect with your client directly. However, before sending messages, you must always have the customer's permission, and you must always give them the right to opt-out of receiving texts at any time.\nMany big brands are already using SMS marketing, such as Amazon. Here are just a few examples of the kinds of messages that are sent with this marketing strategy by some brands:\nConfirmation notices that are delivered to users with a purchase confirmation or order number (Amazon)\nPackage distribution status (Amazon / UPS / FedEX)\n'Thank you' message for picking your brand\nFor certain larger brands, surveys and polling have been popular, as they give the business a deeper view of the consumer.\nAppointment management and electronic alerts (car dealerships/doctors' offices)\nMobile Ads In the Game\nIt's possible that you or someone you meet would have a computer game on their computer. Gaming applications are so common that it is expected that by 2020 there will be 213 mobile gamers. Right today, 78% of mobile owners say they use gaming software on a regular basis and spend six and a half hours a week playing games on average.\nThis makes smartphone advertising an extremely powerful platform for marketing. Ads may act as pop-ups for banners, full-page image advertising, or even video advertisements that appear between loading screens. Mobile advertising in games are a perfect means of capturing a consistent viewer.\nMarketing Based On Location\nLocation-based ads will help ensure that your mobile marketing investment is not spent on consumers who are beyond your service's regional boundaries. For example , if the company just services consumers in New York City, users in Los Angeles do not use ads.\nBusinesses and brands can deliver customised messages to consumers in a particular geographic region using the mobile GPS functionality. You may also set a virtual perimeter around a shop or company, and a warning is activated on their mobile device whenever a customer (who has installed your brand app) enters the area.\nMany social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram offer location targeting, but not smartphone-specific (though many social media users search the applications on their mobile devices). For starters, the Facebook Pixel makes it extremely simple to target your audience with a variety of parameters.\nAnother useful instrument in location-based ads is\nBluetooth Beacons\n. Such systems can be installed by retailers in their shops and can target the position of customers within the store and deliver advertising marketing items that are close to the location of customers within the store.\nWe live in an environment where users are looking, shopping, and playing on a handheld device for hours of their lives. If they wish to keep rising their brands and increasing their profits, advertisers can no longer disregard smartphone ads. If you're aiming to expand the scope of your company or are seeking to keep your social media marketing firm competitive, then it's time to start implementing mobile ads in a big way into your marketing strategy.\nArticle Credits –\ncerealentrepreneur.academy\n#BrandBuilding #MobileMarketing #GrowingBusiness #EmailMarketing #SMSMarketing\nRelated Topic Blog\nHow Can Video Marketing Help SaaS Companies?\nVideo marketing is considered the way of the future by many marketers.

PMI is the process of combining two companies into a single, unified organization. It can be a daunting task, and even the most successful M&A deals can fail if PMI is not done effectively.\nIn the USA, PMI is particularly challenging due to the country’s diverse workforce and corporate culture. When two companies merge, their employees may have different values, work styles, and communication methods. This can lead to conflict, confusion, and a decrease in productivity.\nCase Studies\nHere are some case studies of PMI challenges in the USA:\nThe merger of AOL and Time Warner in 2001 was one of the largest M&A deals in history. However, the PMI was a disaster, and the combined company lost billions of dollars. One of the main challenges was the clash of cultures between the two companies. AOL was a fast-paced, entrepreneurial tech company, while Time Warner was a traditional media conglomerate. The two companies had different values and ways of doing business, and this led to conflict and confusion among employees. (Source: PwC, 2023 M&A Integration Survey)\nThe merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz in 2015 was another high-profile M&A deal. However, the PMI was also challenging. One of the main challenges was the integration of the two companies’ supply chains. Kraft and Heinz had different suppliers and distribution networks, and it took time and effort to integrate the two systems. (Source: Deloitte, Post-Merger Integration: Challenges and Opportunities)\nReal Life Scenarios\nHere are some real-life scenarios of PMI challenges in the USA:\nA US-based tech company acquires a smaller European tech company. The two companies have different product cultures, and it is challenging to integrate the two product teams.\nA US-based manufacturing company acquires a smaller Mexican manufacturing company. The two companies have different labor laws and regulations, and it is challenging to integrate the two HR departments.\nA US-based healthcare company acquires a smaller US-based healthcare company. The two companies have different IT systems, and it is challenging to integrate the two systems.\nHow Occams Advisory Can Help\nOccams Advisory is a leading mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory firm.

The history of the R&D tax credit unveils a narrative of resilience, adaptability, and empowerment for SMBs. In this blog, I walk-through a chronological exploration of this evolution and discuss why the R&D’s impact on business should not be overlooked. There is a concluding FAQ section, and, should you have any further questions or wish to explore how your SMB qualifies, please\nschedule some time with me\n!\nSeeds of Innovation (1950s – 1970s)\nThe roots of the R&D tax credit are traced back to the mid-20th century when industrialized nations sought ways to foster mechanical and scientific advancement. In the post-World War II era, governments recognized the pivotal role of research and development in driving economic progress. In a worldwide sense, the United States led the way with the introduction of investment tax credits in the 1960s, laying the foundation for future incentives aimed at stimulating R&D activities among businesses. It was a prescient moment for the US government- understanding that fiscal motivators in the form of tax credits would engage forward-thinking businesses and foster a culture of creativity.\nLegislation Takes Root (1980s – 1990s)\nThe 1980s witnessed a significant milestone with the enactment of R&D Tax Credits in the United States under the\nEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA)\n. Sponsored by\nSenator William Roth\nand\nRepresentative Jack Kemp,\nand signed by President Reagan, the ERTA provided businesses with a clear, written financial incentive to invest in their innovation. The credit allowed companies to offset a portion of their research expenses against their tax liabilities, which encouraged inventiveness across various industries. It also included the “Discovery Rule” which delineated qualified activities. This was the dawn of the internet era: a time of risk-taking that would bear enormous fruit and would steam the United States economic engine forward on its course of ingenuity. The concept of R&D tax credits gained traction and other nations, including Canada and the United Kingdom, introduced similar tax incentives. A wave of research-driven policy swept the globe. There was one caveat about this early-version of R&D: the credit was written as a temporary measure in the ERTA. It had an expiration date of December 31, 1985. Seeing its popularity and effectiveness, R&D was temporarily extended in the\nTax Reform Act of 1986,\nand again fifteen (!) more times in the years to come leaving the R&D credit in a state of fluctuation during the 1990s.\nMaturation and Expansion (2000s – 2010s)\nThe dawn of the new millennium expedited an era of technological revolution and unprecedented inventiveness. The R&D tax credit evolved in tandem with these advancements, adapting to the definition of what research and development meant to businesses. In 2001, a major change to the R&D credit was made to definition of the “Discovery Rule.” Instead of qualified activities defined as “new to the world,” the new definition simply stated they be “new to the taxpayer.” Further flexibility was reflected when\nAlternative Simplified Credit (ASC)\nwas enacted, allowing businesses to both alter and be more flexible in credit calculations. Governments recognized the diverse nature of innovation and expanded the scope of eligible activities beyond traditional scientific research to include areas such as software development, engineering, and experimental design. This broadened category definition enabled a wider array of businesses, especially SMBs, to benefit from these incentives and nurtured a culture of entrepreneurship.\nR&D is Enshrined (2010s – Present)\nAs the world economy grew more and more competitive, the importance of R&D tax credit policies became evident. It was time to stop kicking the can and enshrine the R&D tax credit as a permanent part of US growth. The\nProtecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH ACT) of 2015\ndid exactly that, making the R&D tax credit a permanent fixture in US tax code. It also turned off what is known as Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which allowed businesses with $50 million or less in gross receipts to claim. The 2010s also saw the\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\n(2018) make R&D credits more achievable by further reducing AMT guidelines for S-corps and C-corps. By this time, the definition of innovation had grown from simply “manufacturing advances” to a mature version that covered hours of labor, both in-house and outsourced (within US borders), spent engaging with complex modern problems such as climate change, alternative energies, and artificial intelligence. The foundation of the R&D credit remained the same but modern economic houses were built very differently.\nThe journey of the Research and Development Tax Credit from its humble beginnings in the ERTA of 1981 to its current permanent status is a testament to the resilience of businesses and the adaptability of United States economic policies. For today’s SMBs, these incentives are a beacon of support that empower leaders to dream, explore, and engage without the burden of excessive financial constraints. It is now evident that R&D tax credits do not simply shape industries- they nurture the very essence of progress and creativity.

Customers who are dissatisfied, stressed colleagues, missing deadlines, and higher costs are just a few of the issues that ineffective systems can cause.\nThat is why, while systems aren't running well, it's important to change them. We'll look at how you can do that in this post.\nConcerning Business Processes\nFormal and informal processes are also possible. Formal methods, also called protocols, are well-documented and follow a set of steps.\nYou may have processes in place for collecting and filing invoices, or for forming new client partnerships, for example. When there are safety, legal, or financial reasons to take such steps, formal processes are especially necessary.\nInformal systems are most likely to be those that you've devised on your own and haven't recorded. You might have your own collection of procedures for noting meeting actions, doing market analysis, or sharing new leads, for example.\nEfficient Processes are Critical\nBoth of these processes share one thing in common: they're all built to make it easier for you and your colleagues to work together.\nThere are less mistakes and delays as everybody takes a well-tested sequence of steps, there is less duplication of work, and employees and consumers are happier.\nProcesses that don't perform will cause a slew of issues. Get the same scenario:\nCustomers may express dissatisfaction with product quality or service.\nColleagues became irritated.\nWork may be duplicated or not completed at all.\nCosts are rising.\nResources are being squandered.\nYou can experience bottlenecks, causing you to miss deadlines.\nImproving the Processes of The Team\nIt might be time to check and amend the appropriate procedure if you run into any of the issues mentioned above. To do so, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Build a Process Map\nIf you've determined which method you want to change, use a Flowchart or a Swim Lane Diagram to log each move. These techniques physically depict the phases in the procedure. (Swim lane diagrams are more complicated than flowcharts, but they're ideal for systems involving several individuals or groups.)\nIt's crucial to go through each phase thoroughly and certain systems can have sub-steps that you're not aware of. To guarantee that you don't miss something important, talk to people who use the process on a daily basis.\nStep 2: Examine the Procedure\nInvestigate the process's issues using the flow map or swim lane diagram. Think of the following issues:\nWhere do members of the staff or clients get irritated?\nAny of the following steps results in a bottleneck?\nWhere do prices rise and/or quality falls?\nWhich of these steps takes the longest or results in the most delays?\nTo map the issue back to its source, use Root Cause Analysis, Cause and Effect Analysis, or The 5 Whys. Over all, if only the signs are addressed, the issues will persist.\nSpeak with others that will be impacted by the operation. What do they think the problem is? What ideas do they have for making things better?\nThen take a look at the other teams in your business. What strategies have they devised to deal with problems like this?\nStep 3: Redesign the Methodology\nYou'll now redesign the procedure to remove the issues you've discovered.\nIt is preferable to collaborate with others who are personally engaged in the process. Their insights can expose novel ways, and if they're interested early in the process, they're more likely to embrace reform.\nTo begin, ensure that everyone knows what the process is supposed to accomplish. Then think about how you should deal with the issues you found in Step 2. (Brainstorming can help here). Make a list of everyone's suggestions for reform, regardless of the cost.\nThen, imagine how the team's proposals can apply and a real-world situation to limit your range of alternative alternatives.\nTo fully comprehend the full results of your team's thoughts, begin by doing an Impact Analysis. Then, inside the revamped method, conduct a Risk Analysis and a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis to identify potential threats and failure points. You may also want to include Customer Experience Mapping at this time, depending on your organization's emphasis.\nThese assessments will assist you in fully comprehending the implications of each proposed proposal, allowing you to make the best choice for all.\nCreate new diagrams to chart each move until you and your team have agreed on a process.\nStep 4: Obtain Resources\nYou must now procure the funding necessary to enforce the new procedure. Have a list of all you'll need to complete this task.\nSenior management or colleagues from other agencies, such as IT or HR, may be able to help. Communicate with each of both organizations to ensure that they are aware of how the new method will help the company as a whole. To explain this, you will need to plan a business case.\nStep 5: Put Change in Place and Communicate It\nChanging internal structures, staff, or procedures is likely to be part of optimizing the business operation. You may need to purchase new software, add a new staff member, or arrange training for coworkers, for example.\nIt's possible that implementing the new method would be a project in and of itself, so schedule and handle it carefully. Set aside time to deal with teething issues, and consider doing a pilot first to rule out any future issues.\nRemember that transition isn't always easy. People may be resistant to change, particularly if it requires a procedure they've been doing for a long time. To conquer aversion to change, you can use methods like the Change Curve and\nKotter's 8-Step Change Model\n.\nStep 6: Evaluate the Procedure\nOnly a few aspects perform flawlessly right out of the gate. So, once you've launched the new method, keep a close eye on how things are going in the weeks and months ahead to make sure it's working as planned. This tracking will also allow you to address issues when they arise.\nMake it a point and ask everyone interested with the latest phase how it's going and what frustrations they're having, if any.\nAdopt\nKaizen-style performance management methods\n. Small tweaks made on a daily basis would keep the process relevant and effective.\n#ImprovingBusiness #EfficientProcesses #Analyze #Implementation #Communication\nArticle Credits –\nmindtools.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nRisk to Business\nWhat is corporate risk?

Anything that undermines the ability of a company to fulfil its financial targets is called a business risk. To build market risk, there are several variables that can collide. It is often the top leadership or management of an organisation that causes circumstances where a company might be subject to a higher degree of risk.\nThe source of risk, however, is often external to a business. Because of this, it is difficult for a business to defend itself fully from harm. There are, however, ways of minimising the overall risks involved with running a business; most organisations achieve this by implementing a risk management approach.\nMain Takeaways\nAny exposure a corporation or company has to factor(s) that can lower its earnings or cause it to go bankrupt is a business risk.\nBusiness risk sources are diverse, but they can vary from changes in consumer taste and demand, the state of the economy as a whole, and the rules and regulations of the government.\nWhile businesses will not be able to eliminate business risk entirely, they may take measures to minimise its effects, including designing a strategic risk strategy.\nBusiness Risk Understanding\nWhen a company faces a high degree of business risk, it can compromise its ability to offer sufficient returns to investors and stakeholders. For example, a company's CEO may make certain choices that impact its earnings, or in the future, the CEO may not correctly predict certain events, allowing the company to suffer losses or collapse.\nA variety of different factors impact market risk, including:\nConsumer expectations, consumption, and quantities of sales\nPrice per-unit and cost of input\nThe Rivalry\nThe general climate of the economy\nRegulations of the Government\nA company with a higher amount of business risk may decide to follow a\nlower leverage ratio\ncapital structure to ensure that it can satisfy its financial obligations at all times. With a low leverage ratio, the company will not be able to pay its debt as sales decline (and this may lead to bankruptcy). On the other hand, a corporation with a low leverage ratio enjoys larger earnings as sales grow and is able to keep up with its commitments.\nAnalysts use four basic equations to quantify risk: commitment margin, leverage effect of activities, financial leverage effect, and overall leverage effect. Analysts should integrate mathematical techniques for more complicated calculations. Usually, market risk arises in one of four ways: competitive risk,\nrisk of compliance\n, organisational risk, and risk of credibility.\nCompany Risk Forms\nThe Strategic Risk\nStrategic risk happens when an organisation does not work according to its business model or strategy. If an organisation does not perform according to its business model, its plan becomes less effective over time and it will fail to meet its established goals. For instance, if Walmart strategically places itself as a low-cost supplier and Aim tries to undercut the costs of Walmart, Walmart becomes a competitive danger.\nChance for Compliance\nCompliance risk is referred to as the second category of market risk. Compliance risk exists mainly in heavily regulated markets and sectors. In the wine industry, for example, there is a three-tier delivery structure that allows wholesalers to distribute wine to a store in the U.S. (who then sells it to consumers). This scheme prevents wineries in some states from exporting their goods directly to retail stores.\nThere are, however, many U.S. states that do not have this sort of logistics system; there is a chance of compliance where a brand fails to recognise the particular specifications of the state in which it resides. A brand avoids being non-compliant with state-specific delivery regulations in this case.\nChance of service\nOperational risk is the third kind of market risk. This danger emerges from inside the organisation, especially when a company's day-to-day practises do not function. In 2012, for example, the international bank HSBC faced a high degree of operating risk and received a substantial fine from the U.S. as a result. Department of Justice because it was unable to adequately combat money smuggling in Mexico through the own anti-money laundering operations unit.\nDamage to credibility\nAny time the credibility of a company is destroyed, either by an incident that was the product of a prior market risk or by a new event, it runs the risk of losing clients and suffering from its brand loyalty. In the wake of the fine it was imposed for weak anti-money laundering activities, HSBC's image faltered.\nUnique Reflections\nIt is not possible to eliminate market risk entirely because it is volatile. There are, however, many techniques employed by firms to reduce the effect of all forms of organisation risk, including financial, compliance, organisational, and reputational risk.\nThe first move that brands usually take is to define in their business strategy all sources of risk. These are not only global threats, but can also come from within the enterprise itself. It is important to take steps to reduce the threats as soon as they show themselves. In order to cope with any identifiable threats before they become too big, management can come up with a strategy.\nWhen a company's management has formulated a strategy to deal with the risk, it is important that they take the additional step of recording everything in case the same scenario happens again. Business risk, after all, is not static; over the business cycle, it continues to repeat itself.\nFinally, a risk control approach is implemented by most firms. This can be done either before or after the organisation launches operations and suffers a failure. Ideally, a risk control plan would allow the business to be more positioned when they present themselves to cope with risks. In the event that danger poses itself, the proposal may have checked concepts and processes in place.\n#BusinessRisk #GovernmentRegulations #Competition #ConsumerDemand #ComplianceRisk\nArticle Credits –\ninvestopedia.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nInvestment Banking's FinTech Landscape: Synergy and Disrupti...\nA look at the latest happenings from across the world as the fintech environment continues to grow.

For many firms, this investment can strain resources, making it essential to leverage every available financial incentive. One such incentive is the R&D Tax Credit, a powerful tool designed to support companies engaged in the development of new or improved products, processes, or software.\nAt Occams Advisory, we understand the critical role financial planning and resource optimization play in the success of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Here is a comprehensive look at how software development firms can maximize their benefits from the R&D Tax Credit.\nUnderstanding the R&D Tax Credit\nThe R&D Tax Credit, established under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §41, provides a significant tax incentive for companies that engage in qualifying research activities. These activities must meet the following criteria:\n1.\nPermitted Purpose:\nThe research must be intended to develop new or improved functionality, performance, reliability, or quality.\n2.\nElimination of Uncertainty:\nThe company must demonstrate that it faced uncertainty at the outset of the project and sought to eliminate it through the research.\n3.\nProcess of Experimentation:\nThe research must involve a process of experimentation to resolve the technical uncertainties.\n4.\nTechnological in Nature:\nThe research must rely on principles of physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science.\nQualifying Activities for Software Development Firms\nFor software development firms, a wide range of activities can qualify for the R&D Tax Credit. These include, but are not limited to:\nDeveloping new software applications\nEnhancing existing software products\nCreating software prototypes\nTesting and debugging software\nIntegrating innovative technologies into existing software\nConducting performance and scalability testing\nFinancial Impact and Benefits\nThe financial benefits of the R&D Tax Credit can be substantial. Companies can claim up to 20% of their qualified research expenses (QREs) as a credit against their federal tax liability. QREs typically include wages for employees directly involved in R&D, costs of supplies used in the research, and a portion of contract research expenses.\nAdditionally, the credit can often be carried forward for up to 20 years, allowing companies to utilize it in future profitable years if they cannot fully use it in the year the expenses are incurred.\nBest Practices for Maximizing the Credit\nTo fully leverage the R&D Tax Credit, software development firms should adopt the following best practices:\n1.\nMaintain Detailed Documentation:\nKeep comprehensive records of all R&D activities, including project plans, time tracking, and detailed descriptions of the technical challenges and solutions.\n2.\nAllocate Costs Accurately:\nEnsure that all QREs are correctly identified and allocated to qualifying projects. This may involve working closely with your financial and technical teams to capture all relevant costs.\n3.\nEngage Experts:\nConsider working with tax professionals who specialize in R&D credits. They can help identify qualifying activities, maximize your credit, and ensure compliance with IRS requirements.\nConclusion\nThe R&D Tax Credit offers software development firms a valuable opportunity to offset the costs of innovation and drive growth. By understanding the qualifying activities, maintaining detailed documentation, and seeking expert advice, companies can maximize their benefits and continue to push the boundaries of technology.\nAt Occams Advisory, we are committed to helping MSMEs navigate the complexities of tax incentives and optimize their financial resources.

ChatGPT can help accountants automate these tasks and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the process. For example, ChatGPT can extract data from financial statements, invoices, and receipts, and convert it into a structured format that can be easily analyzed. This will allow accountants to focus on more strategic tasks and make informed decisions faster.\nEnhanced Bookkeeping and Record Keeping\nBookkeeping and record keeping are crucial activities in accounting, and they can be tedious and repetitive. ChatGPT can help automate these tasks and reduce the risk of errors. For instance, ChatGPT can generate financial reports and update ledger entries based on incoming transactions. This will not only save time but also ensure that the data is up-to-date and accurate.\nImproved Auditing Process\nAuditing is an important part of the accounting process and helps to detect errors, fraud, and other irregularities. With ChatGPT, auditors can automate the process of reviewing financial records, analyzing data, and identifying potential issues. This will not only speed up the process but also help ensure that auditors do not miss any critical issues.\nBetter Customer Service\nIn accounting, customer service is key, and accountants need to respond promptly and accurately to customer inquiries. ChatGPT can assist accountants in providing better customer service by handling routine inquiries, such as account balances, transactions, and payment history. This will allow accountants to focus on more complex inquiries and provide better service to their customers.\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT will have a significant impact on the field of accounting by improving data processing and analysis, enhancing bookkeeping and record keeping, improving the auditing process, and providing better customer service. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the accounting industry and make the process more efficient, accurate, and reliable.\nOverall, the impact of AI on the accounting profession is likely to be positive, as it can help accountants work more efficiently and accurately, freeing up time to focus on more complex tasks. However, it is important to note that AI is not a replacement for human judgment and expertise, and accountants will still need to use their critical thinking and problem-solving skills to make informed decisions.\nAnd that is where exactly we come into play.

One of the most effective ways to support your company’s innovative efforts is through the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit, commonly referred to as the Research and Development Tax Credit under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §41. This Tax Credit is designed to encourage businesses of all sizes to invest in Research and Development activities by providing significant tax savings.\nWhat is the Research and Development Tax Credit?\nThe (R&D) Tax Credit is a federal tax incentive aimed at encouraging companies to invest in innovation and technological advancements. This Tax Credit can reduce your taxable income and increase cash flow, which can be reinvested into further R&D activities. The Tax Credit applies to a wide range of Research and Development activities, making it accessible to many industries beyond just the high-tech sector.\nDetermining Eligibility\nTo qualify for the Research and Development Tax Credit, your company’s activities must meet the following criteria:\n1.\nQualified Research and Development Activities (QRAs):\nThe activities must aim to develop new or improved business components, such as products, processes, software, techniques, formulas, or inventions.\n2.\nTechnological in Nature:\nThe Research and Development must rely on principles of physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science.\n3.\nElimination of Uncertainty:\nThe activities should involve a process of experimentation intended to eliminate technical uncertainty.\n4.\nProcess of Experimentation:\nThis process should include modeling, simulation, systematic trial and error, or other methods aimed at resolving uncertainty.\nQualifying Expenses\nExpenses that typically qualify for the Research and Development Tax Credit include:\nWages:\nCompensation paid to employees directly involved in qualified Research and Development activities.\nSupplies:\nCosts of materials used in the R&D process.\nContract Research and Development:\nPayments to third parties for conducting qualified Research and Development activities on behalf of your company.\nComputer Leasing:\nExpenses related to leasing computers for Research and Development purposes.\nCalculating the Tax Credit\nThe Research and Development Tax Credit is calculated based on a percentage of qualified Research and Development expenses (QREs) over a base amount. The base amount is generally a fixed percentage of your company’s average annual gross receipts over the previous four years. There are two main methods for calculating the Tax Credit:\n1.\nRegular Tax Credit:\nThis is 20% of the QREs over the base amount.\n2.\nAlternative Simplified Tax Credit (ASC):\nThis method is 14% of the QREs that exceed 50% of the average QREs for the three preceding tax years.\nStaying Updated with Recent Changes\nIt’s essential to stay updated with recent changes in tax laws that impact the Research and Development Tax Credit. For instance, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, businesses are required to amortize R&D expenses over five years, beginning after December 31, 2021. Additionally, businesses that expense R&D costs under ASC 730 can still qualify for the Research and Development Tax Credit, ensuring that financial reporting practices align with tax benefits.\nMaximizing Your Benefit\nAt Occams Advisory, we specialize in helping businesses maximize their R&D tax Tax Credits. Our team of experts can assist you in identifying qualified Research and Development activities, ensuring proper documentation, and optimizing your Tax Credit calculations. By leveraging our deep understanding of tax regulations and industry-specific insights, we help you unlock substantial tax savings and reinvest in your company’s innovation journey.\nConclusion\nInvesting in Research and Development and development is crucial for staying ahead in today’s competitive market. The Research and Development Tax Credit provides a valuable opportunity to offset the costs associated with innovation. By understanding the eligibility criteria, qualifying expenses, and calculation methods, your business can effectively leverage this Tax Credit to fuel growth and enhance profitability.\nFor personalized guidance on how to maximize your R&D tax Tax Credits, contact us at Occams Advisory.

Automation, once a tool for efficiency, is now a strategic driver of innovation and competitive advantage. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has evolved beyond rule-based task execution to become an intelligent, adaptive force capable of making decisions, predicting outcomes, and optimizing financial processes in real time.\n“AI is the new electricity.” —Andrew Ng, Founder of deeplearning.ai\nThis succinct observation from Dr. Ng highlights just how foundational AI-driven automation can be for modern financial operations, akin to the revolutionary impact electricity once had on traditional industries.\nRecent market insights suggest that the global RPA market continues to grow at a remarkable pace, driven by increasing adoption in banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI).\nFrom Automation to Intelligence: The Shift in RPA’s Role\nFor years, financial institutions have relied on RPA to streamline back-office tasks such as data entry, transaction processing, and compliance checks. While this has led to measurable efficiency gains, the real transformation is happening as automation becomes predictive, adaptive, and increasingly “agentic.”\nAn AI-powered RPA system no longer just follows predefined rules; it analyzes past trends, identifies anomalies, and even suggests corrective actions. Fraud detection, for example, is no longer reactive. Modern autonomous agents can monitor real-time transaction patterns, flag suspicious activity, and initiate preventive measures before a critical financial risk materializes.\n“We invest heavily in AI, big data, and machine learning to reduce risk, fight fraud, and streamline operations.” —Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\nThis statement underscores how leading banks view AI-driven automation as key to risk mitigation and operational efficiency. New AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants—fueled by recent breakthroughs in natural language processing—can interpret complex user requests, extract relevant data from unstructured text, and even provide nuanced customer support. Industry leaders have been piloting large language model (LLM) solutions to streamline processes such as compliance checks and customer inquiry resolution.\nCase in Point: Loan Processing\nTraditionally a multi-step, time-intensive procedure, loan processing can now leverage agentic AI. Advanced RPA bots integrated with LLMs can verify documents, assess risk profiles, and offer predictive analytics on a borrower’s financial health. Some organizations have reported significant reductions in loan approval times through AI-driven workflows.\nThe Hyper-Automation Movement: What Comes Next?\nThe next frontier in automation is hyper-automation—an ecosystem where RPA integrates seamlessly with AI, machine learning, and advanced analytics to create fully autonomous financial processes. Recognized as a major strategic technology trend, hyper-automation is expected to greatly influence how businesses operate and compete.\nA significant development in recent years has been the rise of “autonomous agents,” AI systems capable of learning from real-time data, self-correcting workflow bottlenecks, and dynamically coordinating tasks across multiple software platforms. In wealth management, for example, hyper-automation can analyze live market data, customer behavior, and risk factors to offer dynamic, real-time portfolio rebalancing—an approach that has reportedly increased client returns for leading asset management firms.\nEntrepreneurs and Startups\nBeyond financial services, this level of automation is revolutionizing industries worldwide. AI-enabled decision-making tools are becoming essential for new market entrants, particularly in heavily regulated sectors like finance. Entrepreneurs and startups entering the U.S. market are leveraging AI-powered decision-making to launch businesses faster, navigate regulatory frameworks, and optimize capital allocation—giving them a powerful, near-immediate advantage.\nRedefining Work: Humans and AI as Collaborative Partners\nOne of the most thought-provoking aspects of this transformation is the evolving relationship between humans and automation. While some fear that AI might replace jobs, many research insights predict that AI will, on balance, create more positions than it displaces, especially in industries requiring complex problem-solving and high-value customer interactions.\nIn financial services, automation takes over repetitive, rule-based tasks, allowing professionals to focus on critical thinking, strategic decision-making, and customer relationships. Rather than handling routine inquiries, human agents can now provide high-value financial advice, while AI-powered chatbots manage transactional queries. Many financial institutions have observed higher customer satisfaction scores when AI and human expertise are combined.\nSimilarly, compliance teams are moving from manual regulatory reporting to AI-assisted risk management, where automation not only identifies risks but also suggests solutions. This shift has been especially impactful given the escalating complexity of global financial regulations.\nSecurity and Compliance in an AI-Driven World\nAs automation becomes more sophisticated, financial institutions face new challenges in security and regulatory compliance. While RPA enhances data accuracy and auditability, adapting to evolving regulatory landscapes—especially as AI systems become more “agentic” and autonomous—requires robust governance frameworks.\nAI-driven automation systems are already being designed to preemptively detect compliance risks, ensuring that financial institutions stay ahead of changing regulations. Pilot programs at major banks have shown significant reductions in compliance-related incidents when AI-powered systems were used for continuous monitoring and real-time auditing.\nFor businesses setting up operations in the U.S., navigating federal and state regulations has always been complex. AI is now playing a crucial role in simplifying business incorporation, tax compliance, and financial forecasting, enabling startups to establish themselves more efficiently than ever before.\nWhat the Next Five Years Look Like for RPA in Finance\nThe momentum behind automation is unstoppable. Over the next five years, financial institutions will move from process automation to full-scale digital transformation. Decision-making will shift from historical data analysis to predictive, AI-driven insights, making financial operations more resilient, scalable, and adaptive. Many experts predict that a significant portion of finance functions could be fully automated in leading organizations within this timeframe.\n1. Agent-Orchestrated Workflows\nAI agents will coordinate multiple RPA bots and software tools, ensuring end-to-end process continuity without human intervention.\n2. Deep Integration with Blockchain\nSmart contracts and decentralized ledgers will interoperate seamlessly with AI-driven compliance tools, creating trustworthy, automated ecosystems for payments and settlements.\n3. Personalized Customer Journeys\nReal-time analytics and LLM-powered chatbots will redefine customer experience, enabling hyper-personalized financial services and on-the-spot product recommendations.\n4. Regulatory Evolution\nRegulators themselves will adopt AI to monitor the financial system more proactively, while institutions integrate compliance modules that automatically interpret new rules and adapt processes in real time.\n5. Entrepreneurial Acceleration\nStartups will benefit from near-instant setup and data-driven financial insights, allowing them to compete with established players from day one.\n“We are at the beginning of a revolution that is fundamentally changing the way we live, work, and relate to one another.” —Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum\nThis broader perspective underscores that advanced automation and AI are part of a larger societal and economic shift, with finance at the forefront of many transformative initiatives. Customers will no longer tolerate delays in loan approvals, payment processing, or investment strategies. Real-time financial services will become the norm, powered by the seamless integration of AI, RPA, and blockchain technologies, with agentic AI systems steering many of the day-to-day operational decisions.\nConclusion: A Defining Moment for Financial Services\nThe future of RPA in financial services is not just about automation—it’s about intelligence, adaptability, and the seamless integration of technology into every level of decision-making. Breakthroughs in agentic AI—those capable of autonomous learning, workflow orchestration, and advanced analytics—are elevating automation to an entirely new level of sophistication.\nWhether it’s preventing fraud, optimizing compliance, or reshaping customer experiences, automation is no longer an optional tool—it’s an imperative. For financial institutions, the question is not whether to adopt intelligent automation but how quickly they can integrate it into their operations.

This blog demonstrates that these can be taken care of by taking firm steps to support startups who have already set up shop or the ones who are planning to land their foot in the market.\nAs the disruption caused by this virus continues, the survival of the small business owners has been jeopardized. According to the survey carried out by Goldman Sachs, more than 40% of the small business owners felt that they cannot continue with their business operations for more than a quarter because of the disruption caused by COVID-19.\nThe current situation that we are in, from the entrepreneurial point of view, is very unsettling. Small business owners are currently going through a barricade of problems to ensure that the business keeps thriving and stays afloat.\nAnd adding to that, the entrepreneurs are facing another problem of employee retention. Because they are trying their best to give the re-assurances to the employees but they themselves are struggling with burnout.\nSo, to help these aspiring entrepreneurs and avoid having to close their businesses, we have created an extensive list of items that will take you through the problem that we, as business owners are in.\n1. Stop Thinking, Start doing.\nThe crisis that we are currently facing right now is asking for quick thinking in these uncertain times. We were not trained to deal with a pandemic. Never had a Plan B for such a thing. Entrepreneurs nowadays are finding themselves overthinking small things and unable to make a decision.\nStart breaking down the steps that you need to do and take them up one by one based on the priority. Because the human brain is coded in such a way that as we start to find small solutions, we are on a spree of finding the next solution. As you start taking proactive measures, you will feel confident and deal with the upcoming problems in a more efficient manner.\n2. Apply for Business grants\nWith the number of businesses getting impacted by COVID increasing, the Canadian govt has addressed the issue and has plans to rectify it. With the introduction of\nfinancial aid resources for entrepreneurs,\nbusinesses can now apply for government help to aid their ailing businesses.\nFor eg. The\nsmall business admin in the US\nis designed to help those who have been hit by the pandemic. Visit the website and check which category do you lie under and apply accordingly.\n3. Pivoting is a good idea\nMany non-essential businesses have chosen to tweak their approach to stay relevant. A lot of these small businesses have focused on\nbuilding online presence\nand got their business from offline to online to hack their way to their customers in these restrictions. Some have even considered diversifying to keep their customers interested.\nFor eg., There was nothing a travel company could do. But “Momondo” started a website to showcase the humanitarian activities around the world during the COVID pandemic to add value to its audience and keep them interested. You cannot just NOT do anything when the situation becomes irrelevant for your business.\n4. How Occams help small businesses\nOur Business Services & Growth Incubation provides start-ups and small businesses growth incubation and essential business services. We foster the development of\nearly-stage ventures\nby providing business services and resources. In addition to the much-needed guidance to emerging entrepreneurs, Occams’ BSGI provides them essential business services such as financial Accounting Advisory, Structuring & Incorporation, Human Capital Advisory (HCA), Marketing & Branding Services (MBS) under a subscription model.\nNot only did the pandemic affect existing businesses but it also impacted upcoming new businesses.

The new AI era has powerful advanced financial tools. Every department in every organization uses AI and finance is no exception.\nBenefits of AI in Finance:\n1. Efficiency:\nAI’s algorithms can boost efficiency by dealing with large and complex datasets in a flash. AI has automated routine work, including data entry, bookkeeping, invoice processing, payment execution, reconciliation, finance closing internal audits, etc.\n2. Accuracy:\nHuman work is prone to errors. AI processes data accurately within a fraction of time. It can also help identify inconsistent and missing data.\n3. Compliance:\nAI makes it easier to understand and comply with the complex accounting standards and applicable laws. AI can monitor relevant compliance issues and provide regulatory reports. AI uses natural language processing to transform data into meaningful insight.\n4. Reporting:\nAI has automated and enhanced multiple reports required by the stakeholders on a daily basis. AI assists in generating various financial reports including cashflow and variances reports. AI can be valuable in identifying outliers and detecting potential frauds.\n5. Analysis:\nAI can process data in real time to provide analysis and help make strategic decisions in real time. Data gets automatically converted into analytical reports and provides trend analysis.\n6. Forecasting & Planning:\nPredictive analytics tools are now increasingly used for forecast and planning. AI provides commentary to support the forecasts provided and the key drivers for the decision making. AI forecast can easily recalibrate with a new set of data provided.\nChallenges to be considered:\n1. Data security:\nThe omnipresent challenge with AI in finance is the threat of confidential data exposure to unauthorized access. All platforms used by the finace should be protected with cybersecurity to protect data breaches and attacks.\n2. Verification:\nThe finance team should be able to verify the AI generated output. The professional should be able to understand the process and methods used by the AI before relying on the provided results.\nConclusion\nCan AI replace humans in Finance?\nIt is extremely unlikely that AI can ever replace the finance professionals entirely. AI helps with quantitative aspects of finance but not qualitative. AI lacks the human element required in finance for judgement, analysis, interpretation, intuition, and empathy. However, people must partner with AI and stay up to date with the latest technologies and capabilities to automate routine work and focus on quality addition to provide greater value. AI should be used as a tool to free up the time on systematic work and focus on creating the system. Finance professionals powered by AI can deal with any complex analysis and make informed decisions.\nWritten by\nPriyanka Bathwal, AVP- Finance, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

This study examines how banks will have to change their operating systems in order to keep up with the changing investment environment and produce the future bank.\nTop Takingaways\nInvestment banks1 face major challenges led by the consequences of COVID-19, changing financial laws, democratization of the industry, increased maturity of consumers, a move to remote working arrangements, and rapid developments in technology. Banks have potential to move towards higher levels of return; however, some business structures and operating platforms are likely to need to be retooled to accomplish this.\nA bifurcation of broker archetypes is likely to be faced by the investment banking industry: \"flow players\" focused on middle and back office functions and \"client capturers\" specialized on front-office functions. This bifurcation would result in an ecosystem of diverse players that is interconnected.\nBanks would likely need to decide which role they want and are able to play within the environment, based on internal and external influences. They will also need to rethink their service delivery around a related flow paradigm, shifting capacities and processes to business provider environments, and maximizing the use of financial technologies, information, and analytics to produce differentiated insight and added value.\nEvolving world of investment banking\nThe global COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic's unparalleled public health, economic and social impacts have exacerbated the factors causing difficulties and accelerating disruption in the investment banking industry: declining share rates, liquidity tension, shifting financial legislation, consumer democratization, competitive pressure, enhanced consumer maturity, shifts to remote\nWe expect investment banking to move from a full-scale service model to a bifurcation with two broker archetypes against this difficult backdrop: \"consumer capturers\" specialized in front-office functions and \"flow players\" focused mainly on middle-office functions (figure 1). In an integrated, increasingly global, and perhaps automated, environment that involves alliances that have different back-office roles, these archetypes would certainly work.\nThe realignment of the sector should generate opportunities for investment banks to press for higher levels of return. Organizations should no longer tinker around the margins, however, to deliver on this agenda. In order to prioritize client-centricity, emerging technology, regulatory recalibration, and the transformation of the workforce and workplace, many will likely need to radically retool their existing market models and organizational frameworks. Moreover, inside the new ecosystem, they can decide which archetype they want and are willing to be.\nWhat is a model for linked flows?\nLinked flow is a streamlined, flexible, customer-centered operating model that enhances the capabilities of a financial institution with those of a partner ecosystem by standardizing and centralizing the supply of non-differentiated resources across the sector to generate cost efficiencies. Leveraging internal and partner data offers insight into maximizing efficiency for the most valuable operations and consumers through sales and cost factors and targets the usage of financial capital.\nAdopting the related flow model would allow investment banks to reimagine their industry on four large topics: modernization of technology, future workforce, consumer centricity and recalibration of regulations. Ultimately, through expanded automation and better tooling, the model can maximize performance, overcome cost issues and produce outcomes with decreased inventory and sales leakage.\nModel of Linked Flow\nIn the future, investment banks would possibly entail shedding non-core assets and redesigning their service delivery around a related flow model, shifting capacity and processes between various geographies and ecosystem partners, and maximizing the use of financial technologies, data and analytics to produce differentiated insight and added value. The investment bank is a data-centered enterprise that focuses on the consumer experience, transferring middle and back office functionality to sell utilities or financial technologies (fintech). In order to forecast their consumer trading practices and risk appetite, a rich data set would allow the bank to model customer behaviour and use artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing.\nThe investment bank is also an agile player in a diverse environment that tackles current industry dynamics and relies on identifying aspects such as risk models and consumer service.\nUltimately, in an investment bank's internal processes, only a few value-add functions will need to be implemented: risk control, payments, internal and external data collection (such as customer data and regulatory reporting data) and general ledger.\nTo deliver this vision, technology exists today:\nThe foundation for a public ledger that minimizes reconciliations is distributed ledger technology.\nOpen-source platforms allow data lakes to store the large amounts of data produced by the enterprise.\nFrom this knowledge, advanced analytics and cognitive technologies will extract value.\nConsiderations of the Archetype\nInvestment banks should consider how their current structure, technological infrastructure, resource supply, product portfolio, and talent pool map to the expected core competencies of each archetype (Figure 2) and, if possible, how to bridge any capacity holes while determining if it will be more beneficial to become a consumer capturer or a flow player:\nHow the investment bank of the future will be established\nAre investment banks able to reconsider, reconstruct and focus on others to boost their sustainability in the future? For certain companies, untangling their current systems, designing and acquiring emerging technology to effectively connect with clients, healthy ecosystem partners (service providers), and harnessing and commercializing the combined potential of internal and partner data can be challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. The possible solution, though, is likely to be decreased competition and/or disintermediation of the market.\nIn order to identify where to concentrate and accelerate progress, banks should consider \"zooming out\" to imagine the future beyond immediate constraints and \"zooming in\" to convert this vision into prioritized programs within a system of concepts that can help lead their journeys.\nThe following are examples of steps to continue the journey:\nIdentify the utilities for either outsourcing or creating mutual internal, bank-wide services functions (for example, for data management and Know Your Customer compliance).\nTo be efficient, consider the governance structures needed for a\nutility-based model\n.\nDecide on standardization driven by industry and consider how the environment will be impacted.\nConsolidate the procedures and functions of operations across asset groups (such as single\npost-trade processing\n).\nTo improve flexibility and build smooth integration, centralize data storage and invest in application programming interfaces.\nTo increase overall performance, achieve quicker time to market, and reduce ownership costs, consider using a flexible, cloud-based architecture.\nExplore the art of digital technologies such as AI, blockchain and sophisticated data processing with the art of the conceivable.\nVia a post-pandemic perspective and the transition from conventional, office-oriented jobs to more mobile workspaces enabled by technological advances, analyze employee and organizational behaviors.\nWhat's in advance?\nAs long as major market penetration hurdles (capital requirements, regulatory oversight, behavioural risk, and long-standing customer relationships) remain in place, investment banks are unlikely to be threatened by technology disruptors or other non-industry rivals for their market share. Investment banks looking to the future, however, should consider leaving costly internal infrastructures in the midst of evolving market conditions and shift towards a linked flow model where external providers provide services for both essential and non-critical functions. The capacity of the investment bank to produce and harness differentiated perspectives from data is its new strategic edge in this new world.\nBank of 2030: Make a bold transition\nFrom now, the future of banking will look very different. Banks will need to start placing plans in place now to help them plan for banking in 2030, in the face of changing customer preferences, evolving technology and new market models.\nIn the next 10 years, how can you accelerate a bold transition in your organization?\n#Investment #Banking #BankOf2030 #Competitiveness #Archetype\nArticle Credits –\ndeloitte.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nFrom What If to Even If: The Mindset Behind Our Momentum\nBlog At A Glance: How Occams Digital turned hesitation into horsepower  Fear vs. Courage: The \"What If\" vs. \"Even If\" Battle  The Occams Digital Leap  This Week, Try This: Flip You...\nRead More\nBreaking down the timeline of the Employee Retention Credit...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction ERC Timeline Future Dates to Look For How Occams Can Help Conclusion FAQ's Citations/SourcesOwners and executives of small- to medium-sized businesse...\nRead More\nTen reasons why a firm should be raising online capital righ...\nOne of the most important problems for entrepreneurs at all levels is collecting money and selling stocks.

Fortunately, with the passing of the Employment Act and the development of funding websites, as long as prospective buyers are led to the Securities and Exchange Commission-registered financing site where their shares are being sold, entrepreneurs can now use the internet to broadcast their offers.\nIn the current climate, this is especially important. Here are 10 reasons why entrepreneurs should boost online capital:\nMeetings face-to - face are not needed.\nThe \"death by 1000 coffees\" process of hopping from meeting to meeting with potentially qualified buyers who can listen to your pitch and determine if they want to buy your stock is the conventional mechanism for raising money. This archaic mechanism has ground to a halt with the latest COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many entrepreneurs emphasising what to do next.\nSet up painlessly\nYou should be able to get live on an online fundraiser website within a couple of weeks if you are a real running company and have your financials and documents reasonably structured. We had a business go live with us at Netcapital just six days after the first phone call.\nMake it simpler to get a \"YES\" decision for investors.\nIt is impossible to distinguish $25,000 or $100,000 from purchasing shares in a start-up venture. Prior to signing a check in the six figures, even the richest ought to have a talk with their significant other. The small investment sizes are far more achievable via online platforms. Closing for $5,000 is potentially much better for investors than closing for $50,000. Especially in times like these, where wallets are tightening, it is particularly important to make it easy for investors to say \"YES.\"\nInvesting in the enterprise digitise and simplify.\nSpeaking of making it easy for investors to say \"YES\"-online portals spare investors the usual hassle of getting 10 pages of deal papers to print, sign, scan and return and then go to their bank account to wire funds to a designated account and routing number. They simply press one major investment button on a portal, attach their bank account, and buy.\nEmpower people who care most about you and your industry to take part\n.\nOn an online platform, you can collect money through the new\nJOBS Act\nand encourage any investor to join in your bid. You are not limited to the richest and most well-connected anymore, but you can now go to those who are most enthusiastic about your business. Five years from now, you don't want to have to justify to your uncle at Thanksgiving dinner why he never had the opportunity to invest in your rocketship business, so give him the chance now!\nCreate brand loyalty.\nYour clients are one of the most influential people who would continue to participate in your company if you give them the chance. There is no better option than enabling certain clients to own equity to develop brand loyalty and create brand ambassadors. It would be more beneficial to customers who are economically incentivized for your accomplishment than you can imagine.\nGet your team engaged in a vital part of your market.\nToo much, conventional fundraising depends on only one person's contributions. Founders / CEOs bear the burden of raising capital alone in a manner that restricts the success of fundraising to the network of only that person. Your whole team will help raise money by online channels. Have your CTO report to her on LinkedIn that the business is collecting funds. Ask the person in your operations to tell all of her Facebook friends they have the potential to invest. In a time where we are both apart, let the team feel more together.\nIntegrate the raising of capital into your tasks.\nFor the CEO, conventional fundraising is a major time investment that requires a great deal of time away from more vital areas of the organisation. Either you get a huge check written and it was a decent use of your time to fly out to Sand Hill Road, or you didn't get the money and you didn't earn anything for your efforts. The efforts, money and resources expended on the road fundraiser is subjective. Utilizing an online network helps you to incorporate your fundraising with other primary programmes. Active ad campaign running? Conduct any commercials leading customers to your investment offering. Sending out your base weekly emails? Notify them of the investing potential. Make a new app? Guide consumers to the prospect of investment as they try it out.\nRelease stress contract.\nIt makes the debates more lively when you put the terms up front and give investors just one decision to make (yes or no). You constantly avoid answering the same 20 questions and the answers to the obvious questions can be found on your offering page by any interested investor. The simplicity of decision-making when leaving out redundant talks makes it easy for an investor to say \"YES\" and makes your life easy as an entrepreneur.\nTake power of your fate.\nDo not rest on your hands and wait until this worldwide pandemic has ended. Take measures that encourage you to do exactly that to build value-\nonline fundraising platforms\n. It also encourages you to set the criteria that you feel are fair, and tells the world that there is a need to invest in your business.\nNow is the time to explore, if you have ever felt that an online forum could be an productive way of fundraising for your company. All is left working from home, investors are disappointed by the public markets' uncertainty and all is glued to the internet waiting for something interesting to entertain their minds. Publish an offering page and excite the world by contacting your network and telling them to read your storey for 10 minutes and give you some suggestions.\nTo enter the digital era, it's time for capital raising. To make it possible, COVID-19 might only be the trigger.\nArticle Credits –\ncrunchbase.com\n#OnlineCapitalRaising #SellingStock #Entrepreneurs #COVID-19 #WFH\nRelated Topic Blog\nWhat is an Investment Banking and What Does It Mean?\nInvestment banking is a branch of banking that specializes on assisting individuals and businesses in raising cash and providing financial advice.

The “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021” (“CAA”) is one of those laws and it provided a way of relief for many businesses, healthcare providers, and other entities affected by the epidemic. The Employee Retention Credit (ERC), which is a chance offered to qualified firms, is one such opportunity. The ERC still has a lot of complexities that can be challenging for employers to understand despite being originally developed as part of the CARES Act and enhanced as part of the CAA. We address some of the most often asked queries about this important credit in our blog.\nWho Are the Eligible Employers?\nAn organisation must be carrying on a trade or operating as a business in the financial years 2020 or 2021, have experienced a full or partial suspension due to the pandemic, supply chain disruptions due to vendors who experienced shutdown orders, or have experienced a significant loss of gross receipts in order to qualify.\nWhat Affects Gross Receipts as a “Significant Decline”?\nThe IRS uses percentages that are based on an organization’s 2019 Gross Receipts to determine what constitutes a “significant fall” in 2020 as opposed to 2021. The drop must be larger than 50% in 2020 and greater than 20% in 2021. This is evaluated on a quarterly basis in both cases and corresponds to the same quarter in 2019. For the year 2021, there is an exception to this rule: if a preceding quarter was required to be larger than 20%, it might be used in place of a prior year.\nWhich Workers Are Eligible?\nFor the 2020 ERC, an employer with 100 or fewer average full-time employees (as measured in 2019) is defined as a small employer.\nFor the 2021 ERCs, an employer with 500 or fewer full-time employees (as measured in 2019) is defined as a small employer.\nThe term “full-time employee” means an employee who, with respect to any calendar month in 2019, had an average of at least 30 hours of service per week or 130 hours of service in the month (130 hours of service in a month is treated as the monthly equivalent of at least 30 hours of service per week), as determined in accordance with section 4980H of the Code.\nWhat Quarters Can the ERC Be Reclaimed For?\nThe eligibility determines how many quarters may be claimed. Wages paid between 3/13/20 and 9/30/21 are eligible for the ERC credit. Wages paid between 7/1/21 and 12/31/21 are eligible for starting firms.\nCan I Make an ERC Claim If I Got a PPP Loan?\nYes. You can now claim the ERC credit even if you had a PPP loan thanks to the revisions made by the CAA Act and enacted into law. Simply put, we cannot spend identical funds, dollar for dollar. This factor is taken into consideration while determining your ERC qualification.\nHow much might be claimed annually? What Wages Are Eligible?\nThe credit equals 50 percent of the qualified wages (including qualified health plan expenses) that an Eligible Employer pays in a calendar quarter. The maximum amount of qualified wages taken into account with respect to each employee for all calendar quarters is $10,000, so that the maximum credit for qualified wages paid to any employee is $5,000.\nExample 1:\nEmployer M pays $10,000 in qualified wages to Employee A in the second quarter of 2020. The Employee Retention Credit available to Employer M for the qualified wages paid to Employee A is $5,000.\nExample 2:\nEmployer N pays $8,000 in qualified wages to Employee B in the second quarter 2020 and $8,000 in qualified wages in the third quarter 2020. The credit available to Employer N for the qualified wages paid to Employee B is equal to $4,000 in the second quarter and $1,000 in the third quarter due to the overall limit of 50 percent of $10,000 of qualified wages per employee for all calendar quarters.\nHow is the ERC Said to Work?\nThe employee wage requirements are used to calculate the ERC credit, which is subsequently claimed by revising the related payroll tax reports.\nHow soon must I submit an ERC claim?\nAfter submitting Form 941, amended payroll tax returns may be filed three years later. Accordingly, you have till Q1 of 2023 for Q1 of 2020, Q1 of 2021 until Q1 of 2024, and so on.\nAre ERC credits tax deductible?\nERC credits are not considered to be taxable income. It does, however, change your payroll costs. The precise amount of your refund must be communicated to your CPA so they can accurately report the changes on your business tax returns after you get it.\nWhat Will Happen Next?\nDespite the fact that the procedure can be complicated, the following easy stages will assist you in navigating the ERC:\na) To find out if you qualify, complete our Qualification form.\nb) Obtain your 941 forms and payroll data so that we can start computing your credit.\nc) Work with our staff to submit all the necessary documentation and information.\nYou’ll then have a better idea of the types of funding your company is eligible for. We at\nOccams\nare dedicated about guiding small businesses through these challenging situations and trying procedures.

These plans are a popular way to save for retirement, with millions of Americans relying on 401k plans for their retirement savings.\nCurrent State of 401k Plans\nCurrently, 401k plans have contribution limits of $19,500 for employees under 50 years of age and $26,000 for employees over 50 years of age. Employers can also contribute to these plans on behalf of their employees, up to a certain limit.\nThe Changes Coming to 401k Plans in 2023\nStarting in 2023, the contribution limits for 401k plans will increase. Employees under 50 years of age will be able to contribute up to $20,000, while employees over 50 years of age will be able to contribute up to $27,000. Additionally, the limit on employer contributions will increase to $44,000.\nReal-Life Scenarios\nHere are two real-life scenarios that demonstrate how the changes to 401k plans in 2023 may affect retirement planning:\nScenario 1: Tom is 45 years old and currently contributes the maximum amount allowed to his 401k plan. When the new contribution limits go into effect in 2023, Tom will be able to contribute an additional $500 to his retirement savings each year.\nScenario 2: Jane is 55 years old and plans to retire in 10 years.

If you don't, you'll probably end up with increased prices, reduced earnings, less enthusiastic workers, and dissatisfied clients.\nBusiness process management (BPM) is a valuable mechanism that companies can use to ensure that all facets of their processes operate smoothly. Here's why the organization wants enterprise process management if you're thinking about investing in it to boost processes.\nWhat exactly is BPM?\nBusiness process management, according to Gartner, is \"a discipline that drives organizational efficiency and business agility to boost organization results.\" Consider a company to be an engine, and BPM to be a method for fine-tuning each part of that engine to reach peak efficiency.\nWhat is the purpose of BPM?\nThere are standard business processes in any organization that are structured to achieve goals. Any systems, nevertheless, can be sluggish, costly, ineffective, duplicative, and redundant for a variety of reasons. A BPM examines all of these systems from a new perspective, using models, metrics, and research to assess them and find changes that can increase efficiency. Businesses should use BPM to ensure that new systems integrate seamlessly and perform well as they are implemented.\nWhat are the biggest advantages of BPM applications and what do you aim for?\nSimply put, a business process management (BPM) platform allows businesses to process more for better efficiency, reduced waste, and less time. This is especially beneficial for startups and other businesses with limited resources that need to achieve profitability rapidly.\nThe basic advantages of BPM for businesses can be divided into three categories:\nEffectiveness.\nMany systems are prone to waste due to a variety of reasons, including manual labour, ineffective interdepartmental handoff, and a general failure to adequately track overall development. Companies will identify and eliminate inefficiencies by shining a new eye on operations, which benefits the bottom line.\nThe ability to be successful.\nBPM can be used to make a procedure more successful until it has become more functional. The ability to treat exceptions quicker and easier, make better, more rational choices, and perform reliably, which is crucial for delivering a better consumer experience, are just a few of the many advantages of increased process effectiveness. Companies become more efficient and competitive as all operations are running smoothly and are consistent with business goals and priorities.\nAdaptability\n. The need for an organization to be agile is more important than ever before in today's ultra-competitive business environment. Companies of old, inflexible systems, on the other hand, would be left behind. The desire for reform will come from both within and outside an organization. In order to take advantage of new openings, you can need to make some adjustments. Change may be needed to satisfy new business partners or clients who have a particular way of doing business. Remember that state, federal, and foreign regulations can compel a company to alter its procedures.\nCommercial process optimization platform that is widely used\nWhen looking for the right enterprise process management tools, there are several choices to consider. The decision you make is influenced by a number of considerations, including the cost of the software, whether you want the software to be available to in-house employees, remote employees, or a mix of both, and the program's ease of use.\n#BusinessProcessManagement #BPMSoftware #Efficiency #BPMBenefits\nArticle Credits –\nbusiness.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nSupreme Court Upholds Tax on Foreign Investments in Moore vs...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Understanding the MRT Provision    The Prosecution’s Argument Victory For the Status Quo Good News For the Moore Wealthy Introduction On June 20th, t...\nRead More\nThe Balancing Act of Persistence and Patience in Developing...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Understanding Automation in Context Persistence plays a crucial role in automation development Patience plays a crucial role in automation developmen...\nRead More\nFrom Data to Delivery: Integrated Brand Communications for t...\nThis Research Blog synthesizes a comprehensive empirical analysis of brand communications in the United States with advanced, practice-driven...\nRead More",

Debugging and Troubleshooting:\nInevitable errors arise during development, and a persistent mindset helps developers persevere through frustration. Methodical testing, analyzing logs, and refining code are essential steps in resolving complex issues, such as edge cases or unpredictable API behavior.\n2. Learning New Technologies:\nThe automation landscape is constantly evolving, and persistence is vital for learning and mastering new platforms, frameworks, or languages. Understanding AI tools or software testing frameworks like Selenium often requires extensive experimentation and research.\n3. Iterative Improvement:\nAutomation solutions often start as rough prototypes. Persistence ensures continuous refinement, enhancing efficiency, reducing errors, and expanding functionality. This iterative approach often involves revisiting solutions multiple times to improve performance.\n4. Overcoming Roadblocks: Developers encounter various roadblocks,\nincluding limited documentation and incompatible tools. A persistent attitude maintains momentum, ensuring progress even in the face of unexpected challenges.\nPatience plays a crucial role in automation development,\ncomplementing persistence by encouraging steady and thoughtful work rather than rushing toward completion. It enables developers to endure delays and setbacks without losing focus or motivation.\nPatience is essential for several aspects of automation:\n1. Thorough Planning:\nJumping straight into coding without understanding the problem can lead to wasted effort. Patience allows developers to take the time needed to map out workflows, identify edge cases, and determine the best tools for the job. A well-planned solution is often more robust and easier to maintain.\n2. Testing and Validation:\nEffective automation requires rigorous testing. Patience ensures that developers thoroughly validate their solutions, testing for various scenarios and edge cases. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Skipping these steps can lead to unreliable systems and costly rework.\n3. Stakeholder Collaboration:\nStakeholders may not always articulate their requirements clearly, and their needs may evolve. Patience is essential for engaging in constructive dialogue, refining the solution based on feedback, and ensuring the final product aligns with expectations.\n4. Long-Term Vision:\nAutomation projects often have long-term goals, such as reducing operational costs or improving customer satisfaction. Achieving these outcomes requires patience, as the full benefits may not be immediately apparent.\nStriking the right balance between\npersistence and patience is crucial for developers. Too much persistence without patience can lead to burnout, while excessive patience without persistence can result in stagnation. Here are some strategies to help you achieve this balance:\n1. Set Realistic Goals:\nDefine clear and achievable milestones for your project. Break it down into smaller tasks and celebrate your progress along the way. This will help you stay focused on attainable outcomes and prevent frustration.\n2. Adopt Agile Practices:\nAgile development methodologies encourage iterative progress, frequent reassessments, and collaboration with stakeholders. These practices inherently balance persistence (through continuous delivery) and patience (by allowing flexibility and time for adaptation).\n3. Embrace a Growth Mindset:\nRecognize that setbacks are opportunities for learning. A growth mindset fosters resilience and encourages developers to persist through challenges while maintaining patience for long-term development.\n4. Leverage Collaboration:\nWorking in a team environment helps balance individual strengths and weaknesses. Persistent team members can drive momentum, while patient team members ensure a steady and thoughtful approach.\n5. Prioritize Self-Care:\nBurnout is a real risk for developers. Regular breaks, maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and practicing mindfulness can help sustain both persistence and patience throughout a project.\nCase Study 1: Automating E-Check Processing at Equipay\nEquipay, a payment solutions provider, automates the acceptance of e-checks for merchants through a multi-stage workflow. This process includes customer verification, bank account validation via third-party APIs, compliance checks, and e-check processing through an ACH provider.\nThe system offers multiple integration workflows, including web store APIs, Equipay terminals, and bulk CSV uploads.

This evolution is not merely an extension of existing tactics but a fundamental inversion of traditional marketing dynamics.\nHere’s a deep dive into what this means for marketers, brands, and consumers.\n1. From Push to Pull: The New Dynamics of Consumer Engagement\nHistorically, marketing has been about pushing messages to audiences through mediums like billboards and TV ads. In the AI-driven future, the focus shifts dramatically from pushing messages to making products and services optimally discoverable by AI systems. Intelligent systems will “pull” relevant offerings into their decision space when they meet specific needs, fundamentally changing how visibility in the market is achieved.\n2. From Scarcity to Abundance: Managing the Overflow\nIn traditional marketing, strategies revolve around the scarcity of resources—be it ad space, creative input, or consumer attention. AI overturns this by offering infinite content variations, personalization, and interaction points. However, this abundance creates a new form of scarcity: the lack of trust and authentic human connections. Marketers must now pivot from managing resource scarcity to curating a wealth of content, focusing on quality and relevance.\n3. From Static to Fluid: The Evolution of Marketing Campaigns\nForget fixed campaigns and set schedules. In the age of AI, marketing campaigns are living, evolving entities that adapt in real-time based on continuous feedback. This dynamic environment means marketers will set parameters for campaigns to self-evolve rather than adhere to predetermined paths, posing new challenges in flexibility and real-time decision-making.\n4. From Human to Hybrid Markets: Navigating Complex Ecosystems\nThe marketplace is evolving into a complex ecosystem where you’re not just marketing to humans but also AI agents and hybrid systems. Understanding the nuances of these new market “species” is crucial. The strategy will involve deciphering and influencing a mix of human and AI-driven decisions, making the marketer’s role more sophisticated and integrated.\n5. From Metrics to Memory: Building Brand Legacy\nWhile AI excels at optimizing for immediate metrics like clicks and conversions, the future of marketing emphasizes creating lasting brand memory and cultural resonance. Legacy brands with rich histories and deep-seated consumer relationships have an edge here. In an AI-dominated landscape, the challenge for new brands will be to build this kind of equity, which cannot be quickly replicated through optimization alone.\nRethinking Marketing Functions\nCreation Becomes Curation:\nWith AI capable of generating endless content variations, the marketer’s role will increasingly focus on curating rather than creating, selecting content that aligns best with brand strategy and audience needs.\nTargeting Becomes Teaching:\nTraditional targeting is transformed into educating AI systems about your products’ unique attributes to enhance their ability to match these offerings with the right opportunities.\nCampaigns Become Ecosystems:\nMarketing initiatives will morph into ecosystems that adapt organically to market responses. Marketers will initiate conditions and guide developments but will not control every aspect.\nAnalytics Becomes Intelligence:\nMoving beyond mere data analysis, marketers will need to understand and interact with complex market dynamics that include both human and AI behaviors.\nWhy Legacy Brands Have an Edge\nIn a world where AI can optimize anything quickly, the enduring value of a brand built over decades becomes a significant advantage. These brands’ deep roots and authentic connections make them more trusted and preferred, despite the presence of newer, possibly more optimized competitors.\nThe Path Forward\nThis isn’t just about adding AI into the marketing mix but rather understanding a completely new marketplace landscape. Success will hinge on:\nEmbracing a systems and networks mindset over campaigns and funnels.\nDeveloping capabilities to engage both human and AI market participants.\nBalancing swift AI-driven optimizations with long-term brand building and authenticity.\nAs we navigate this new era, the key will be not just to adapt but to lead through understanding and innovating within these inverted dynamics. Welcome to the new age of marketing, where the integration of AI demands a re-evaluation of strategies, and the true power lies in balancing technological advancements with the intrinsic value of genuine brand building.\nWritten by Harsh Golani, Lead– Brand Communications, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

By following these five actionable steps, you can effectively manage your money, reach your financial goals, and enjoy peace of mind.\nStep 1: Set Financial Goals\nSetting clear financial goals provides direction and motivation. Identify short-term and long-term goals, such as saving for a down payment, paying off debt, or planning for retirement. Write them down and create a timeline to track your progress.\nStep 2: Create a Budget and Track Expenses\nA budget helps you allocate your income effectively and track your expenses. Identify your income sources and categorize your expenses. Use budgeting tools or apps to track your spending and make adjustments as needed to ensure you’re staying within your financial limits.\nStep 3: Build an Emergency Fund\nAn emergency fund provides a safety net during unexpected situations. Aim to save three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a separate savings account. Start small and gradually increase your savings over time. Automate regular contributions to make saving easier.\nStep 4: Pay Off Debt and Manage Credit\nDebt can hinder financial progress. Develop a plan to pay off high-interest debts first while making minimum payments on other debts. Consider debt consolidation or negotiation to lower interest rates. Monitor your credit score and maintain a healthy credit utilization ratio.\nStep 5: Invest for the Future\nInvesting allows your money to grow over time. Research different investment options, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. Consider working with a financial advisor to develop an investment strategy aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.\nReal-Life Scenarios: Individuals Achieving Financial Success\n1.

You can also consider using financial apps or tools that provide visualizations and reports to help you track your progress over time.\nWhat are some strategies for reducing expenses and saving money?\nTo reduce expenses and save money, consider creating a monthly budget, identifying areas where you can cut back on discretionary spending, negotiating bills and expenses, shopping for better deals, and implementing cost-saving habits such as meal planning, energy conservation, and using coupons or discounts whenever possible.\nHow much should I save for retirement?\nThe amount you should save for retirement depends on various factors such as your desired retirement lifestyle, current age, expected retirement age, and estimated expenses. It’s generally recommended to save at least 10-15% of your income for retirement, but working with a financial advisor can help you determine a more specific savings target based on your individual circumstances.\nIs it necessary to work with a financial advisor?\nWhile working with a financial advisor is not mandatory, it can be beneficial, especially if you have complex financial goals or need guidance in developing an investment strategy. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice, help you navigate complex financial matters, and ensure you make informed decisions aligned with your goals.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, managing your personal finances successfully is crucial for financial stability and achieving your financial goals.

It included two programs to assist businesses with\nkeeping workers employed: the\nPayroll Protection Program (PPP)\nadministered by\nthe\nSmall\nBusiness Adminstration\nand\nEmployee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC)\nadministered by the\nInternal Revenue Service.\nPPP funds are distributed based on 2.5 months of payroll and a minimum of 80% of the\nfunds must be used on payroll to be eligible for forgiveness. Additionally, PPP funds\nare not taxable as revenue and you may still take deductions for the payroll covered by\nPPP.\nERTC tax credits, however, are credits (or refunds) for a percentage of payroll in each\nquarter that you qualify. There are specific rules for determining eligibility by\nquarter, and limiting the dollars that can be claimed for each employee.\nERC eligibility requirements\nEmployer eligibility is largely determined by one of two key factors, at least one of\nwhich must apply in the calendar quarter the employer wishes to utilize the credit: Full\nor partial closure due to a government order. A business is eligible for the ERC if they\nwere forced to fully or partially suspend operations (FPSO) or reduce business because\nof a government COVID-19 order. Credit applies only for the part of the quarter the\nbusiness is suspended, not the entire quarter. There are certain businesses that\ngenerally do not meet this description and would not qualify:\nThose considered essential, unless they have supply of critical material or goods\ndisrupted in a manner that affects their ability to continue to operate. Businesses\nshuttered but continuing their operations largely as normal (telework). A significant\ndecline in gross receipts\nFor tax year 2020, the business must have seen a 50 percent drop in gross receipts when\ncomparing a quarter in 2020 with the corresponding quarter in 2019.Beginning in 2021,\nbusinesses must have seen more than a 20 percent drop in gross receipts in Q1 and Q2\ncompared to the same quarter in 2019. A new business is allowed to use gross receipts\nfor the quarter in which it started business as a reference for any quarter in which it\ndid not have 2019 figures.\nWhat are “qualified wages” and how to claim credits?\nQualified wages are compensation paid by an employer to some or all FTE’s in the relevant\nquarter. Qualified wages include the employer’s qualified health plan expenses that are\nallocable to the wages.The ERC is applied to employer’s contribution to Social Security\n& Medicare taxes and is fully refundable. In order to claim ERC, you must calculate\ntotal qualified wages and the related health insurance costs for each quarter, and\nretroactively claim the credit through Form 941-X.\nThe Million Dollar Question is . . . Do They Have The Time?\nDo they have the time to dig into the text of American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nAnd its accompanying referenced laws like:\nCARES Act, Families First Act, Payroll\n&\nHealthcare Enhancement Act, PPP Payroll Flexibility Act\nand the\nConsolidated\nAppropriations Act.\nTime to read the\nIRS Interpretations and FAQ’s\n? And cross-reference those\ndefinitions with that of PPP which was separately defined and dissimilarly\ninterpreted in the\nSmall Business Administration’s Bulletins and IFRs?\nDo they have the time to ensure accuracy in eligibility determination, maximize your\ncomputation and create the supporting documentation you’ll need to support an IRS\naudit of employer taxes?\nSo far, we have not found a bookkeeper who is able to take all this on, while handling\nthe day-to-day of bookkeeping. If yours can, then take them up on their offer. We’re\nhappy to take a second look.\nHow does the number of employees factor into the ERC?\nThe rules are different depending on how many employees you have. The updated 2021\nprogram bumped these categories up from 100 full-time employees (FTE’s) in 2019 to 500\nFTE’s in 2019. Employers with 500 or fewer FTE’s in 2019 can apply the ERC towards all\nqualified wages paid to employees during those quarters, whether or not employees were\nworking at the time. Employers with more than 500 full-time employees can apply the ERC\ntowards qualified wages paid to employees who were not working during a quarter because\nthe business suspended operations or had a significant decline in gross receipts. These\nemployers can only count wages up to the amount that the employee would have been paid\nfor working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the period\nof economic hardship.\nI got PPP funds already. Can I also get ERTC?\nInitially with the\nCARES Act,\nemployers could choose to apply for PPP or claim\nERTC credits, but not both.\nPPP was more beneficial than ERTC for most businesses (for reasons we won’t go into here)\nand so most businesses with under 500 employees received forgivable PPP Loans.\nOn March 11, 2021,\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nwas signed into law and\nincluded many modifications and expansions to existing elements of previous stimulus\nprograms.\nNoteworthy modifications for business owners included:\nBusinesses who applied for and received PPP funds could now also claim ERTC\ncredits.\nERTC credits could be\nretroactively claimed\nfor businesses that qualified in\n2020.\nERTC credits were extended through 9/30/21 with lower qualification requirements.\nThe per-employee cap on qualifying wages increased from $10,000 for all of 2020 to\n$10,000 per quarter for the first 3 quarters of 2021.\nThe refundable credit amount increased from 50% of qualifying wages in 2020 to 70%\nin 2021.\nSo the short answer is\n“Yes”\n. . . you can claim ERTC even if you received PPP\nfunds.\nHow do I apply for ERTC tax credits?\nUnlike the\nPayroll Protection Program\n(administered by the Small Business\nAdministration), there is actually no “application process” for the\nEmployee\nRetention Tax Credits.\nYou simply claim the ERTC tax credit like you would any other tax credit – by asserting\nto the IRS that you can legally claim the credit.\nWhen you claim a child tax credit, you do so by asserting this fact on your Form 1020\nPersonal Income Tax Return.\nThe difference is that when you claim an ERTC tax credit, you do so on your Form 941\nEmployer Quarterly Tax Filing.\nFor prior quarters, you must file an amended form (the Form 941-X) to reduce your current\nquarter’s tax contribution and request a refund of excess credits (which is highly\nlikely).\nAnother perk of ERTC, is that since you can often estimate these credits in advance of\ndistributing cash for payroll, you can file a Form 7200 to receive a cash advance to\navoid waiting until the end of the quarter to apply for the refund.\nMy revenue in Q1 2021 is back to pre-pandemic levels - so I must be ineligible - right?\nEven though you may feel like revenue is back to normal, there are some items you want to\nconsider before passing on this ERTC assessment.\nFirst, even if revenues have returned to “normal” in 2021, you\nmay have qualified in\n2020 and you can retroactively claim those credits.\nThat eligibility criteria in\n2020 was based on revenue declines from 2019, or if your business was partially or fully\nclosed due to governmental mandate.\nSecond, while your revenue may have returned to “normal” in Q1 2021, remember that\nwe\nare comparing your Q1 2021 to Q1 2019.\nIf 2019 was a year of growth for your\nbusiness, then your revenue levels 2 years ago may have been much less than Q1 2020.\nAnd lastly, if your revenues were down in\nQ4 2020 by just 20% compared to Q4 2019,\nthen you may also be eligible for Q1 2021. There is a safe harbor provision that few\nadvisors are talking about, and it means that many businesses are qualifying for $7,000\nper employee in Q1 2021.\nI know, it seems too good to be true, but the government wants to incentivize and reward\nyou for keeping US residents employed and money flowing through our economy as we\nrebuild bigger and stronger than before.\nI thought payroll taxes deferred in 2020 had to be re-paid. Does ERTC work the same way?\nYou are most likely referring to a provision of the\nCARES Act\nthat allowed\nemployers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer’s share of Social Security\ntaxes. Those deferrals must then be repaid – with at least 50% of the balance due by\n12/31/21 and the remaining balance due by 12/31/22.\nERTC credits are\nNOT\na deferral. They are dollar-for-dollar credits against wages\nyou’ve paid. Not taxes you’ve paid, but actual wages.\nThese credits can offset future tax contributions or you can receive a refund check –\nit’s your choice.\nAnd you will\nNOT\nhave to re-pay these funds (unless, of course, you don’t provide\nadequate documentation in the course of an audit).\nWhy isn't my bank talking about this?\nYour banker was probably very helpful when it came to getting your PPP funds because they\nwere effectively signing you to an SBA-guaranteed loan. The SBA paid the bank\nadministrative fees based on the PPP loans they made, and so they were incentivized to\neducate you about the program and get all your paperwork in order.\nCompared to the ERTC, the PPP program was also a rather simple calculation. 2 ½ times\nyour average monthly payroll including health insurance and state unemployment taxes.\nFrom the conversations we’ve had with bankers, they have no interest in involving\nthemselves in your employment tax compliance. For them it is a liability and beyond\ntheir scope of services.\nWill my Tax CPA handle this for me since they handle my income tax returns?\nWhether your tax accountant is a CPA or EA, he or she most likely only prepares your\nFederal and State Income Tax Returns. However, ERTC credits are claimed against\nEmployment Taxes on Form 941, and cash advanced through Form 7200.\nThe complexity of the ERTC program is a beast unto itself and every tax accountant we’ve\ntalked to has said they focus on staying up-to-date on the ever-evolving income tax\ncode, and they can’t now become experts in the ERTC program as well.\nIf your tax accountant is comfortable determining your eligibility by quarter and year,\ncomputing your credits, and preparing contemporaneous documentation to support an IRS\naudit, then you should certainly let them handle all of this.\nIf you want a second set of eyes on this, we’re happy to take a look.\nWhat about my Payroll Service Provider? Shouldn't they be on top of this?\nYour Payroll Service does an excellent job of executing the fundamentals of paying your\nemployees, paying your employment taxes and filing your quarterly reports.\nBut computing your ERTC credits requires visibility into your P&L and PPP forgiveness\napplications. Not only that, but the complex requirements around eligibility and\nallocating ERTC credits at the employee-level while accounting for annual and quarterly\nqualifying wage gaps and . . . well, you can probably tell why Payroll Services are not\noffering to do all of this for you.\nThe Payroll Services that we’ve worked with so far are happy to provide the payroll\nregisters that we need to perform the allocations. And they are happy to file the\nAmended Form 941-X\nwith the IRS on our client’s behalf.\nBut that’s the extent of it.\nIn fact, most wise Payroll Services are asking clients to sign an indemnification waiver\nbefore submitting a Form 941-X because the Payroll Service can take no responsibility\nfor the accuracy of the ERTC credits you are claiming.\nFor them to involve themselves in the intricacies of this calculation, it is a liability\nand beyond their scope of services.\nWhy did the IRS issue a warning about 3rd party processing companies?\nThe IRS issued these warnings, as there are many fly-by-night, so-called ERC “experts” or\n“consultants” that are misrepresenting their experiences and the parameters of the ERC\nprogram to employers. The ERC is a complicated tax program that requires deep expertise\nand understand of the nuances. When choosing an ERC company look for companies with a\nproven real track record and watch out for red flags (e..g, large upfront cost, no CPAs\nor tax professionals on staff)\nHow long does the IRS have to audit my ERC?\n“The IRS Audit period for ERC is:\n3 years for 2020 and Q1,Q2 of 2021\n5 years for Q3 of 2021 “\nAre there any restrictions on how I can spend my ERC refund?\nUnlike a loan or other form of business funding, the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is a\nfully refundable tax credit that does not come with limitations on how it can be spent.\nAs a result, businesses that qualify for the ERC can choose to spend their refund in any\nway they see fit.\nBrowse All\nFAQ's\nFREE LANDING INSIGHTS ON EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT\nSubmit",

The ERC is a fully refundable payroll tax refund introduced by Congress in 2020 to help SMBs keep employees on payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic (remember that?!). In a perfect world, understanding how your business qualifies and claims your ERC is cut and dry, but this is not a perfect world; this is the COVID era where government policies, congressional acts, and corresponding tax liabilities change with the stroke of a pen. The ERC can be worth up to $26,000 per employee per eligible employer. Join me for a deep dive (a 7 min read) into the timeline of change regarding the ERC, future dates to be aware of, and how Occams Advisory helps your organization Explore, Review, and Calculate your path to a proper and diligent claim. The ERC began as part of the CARES Act, signed on March 27, 2020 by President Trump in response to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The CARES Act holds the crown for the largest economic stimulus package in history, sections of which were greeted with equal parts skepticism and fanfare. But it was very real. Individual citizens of the United States confirmed its reality when the first round of personal stimulus checks arrived in bank accounts on April 11, 2020 and business owners saw an immediate benefit through the mostly forgiven Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Joining these two stimuli, the ERC was also included in the CARES Act, although at the time the credit was an “either/or” with the PPP and was limited to post-shutdown quarters of 2020. This was the first stage of evolution for the ERC, with many updates on the horizon.\nERC Timeline\nOn December 27, 2020, Congress passed, and President Trump signed, the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act\n(CAA). Perhaps the most important act relative to the ERC, the CAA included more stimulus relief combined with an omnibus spending bill to prevent a government shutdown. The CAA expanded the ERC with key points:\nThe gross receipts threshold for Significant Decline in Gross Revenue (SDGR) qualification was reduced to 20% for quarters in 2021\nThe small employer cap for qualification was raised to 500 for quarters in 2021\nIt included the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act, which held its own expansions for the ERC\nIt increased the eligibility timeframe to include the first two quarters of 2021 (up to Sept 30, 2021)\nIt allowed eligible employers to claim ERC up to 70% of qualified wages per eligible employee up to $10,000 per quarter\nEmployers who took PPP loans were now able to claim the ERC for wages that were not treated as payroll costs in obtaining forgiveness of the PPP loan\nThe CAA is critical to understand, as at the time of its signing many businesses were locked in survival mode, confused (rightly) about ERC eligibility, or simply missed this news in the whirlwind.\nOn March 1, 2021, the IRS clarified the items included in the ERC with\nNotice 2021-20\nis over one hundred pages long and defines the routes of eligibility:\nEITHER\nA. Significant Decline in Gross Revenue (SDGR)\nOR\nB. Full or Partial Suspension of Operations (FPSO), which had previously been more loosely defined\nIncluded in the notice were 71 questions and answers providing guidance and examples that illustrated the rules of the ERC. It also explained when and how employers who previously claimed a PPP loan could claim the ERC for eligible quarters in 2020. Notice 2021-20 defined the meaning of “nominal impact” in relation to FPSO qualification and immediately gave business owners and tax advisors a better understanding of the ERC.\nJust a few weeks later, on March 11, 2021, congress passed, and President Biden signed, the\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021\n(ARP). With the guidelines for ERC qualification laid out in Notice 2021-20, the ARP built on the measures in the CARES and CAA, and expanded (again) the ERC to include the third and fourth quarters of 2021 (later to be revised to just Q3). It also included two more notable routes to stimulate small businesses:\nThe Recovery Startup Business Credit\nA provision of the ERC\nWrote that small businesses launched after Feb 15, 2020 could claim up to $7,000 per employee per quarter in Qs 3&4 2021, capped at $100,000 and with average revenue brackets for qualification\nThe Restaurant Revitalization Fund\nA grant program, separate from the ERC\nFor restaurants and bars to meet payroll and other expenses\nI include the Restaurant Revitalization Fund because there is a common misconception that conflates it with the ERC\nThe United States economic recovery from COVID continued for months until November 15, 2021, when congress passed the\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n(IIJA). Also known as the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law” (BIL), the IIJA was a response to worries about overspending and overeager stimulus. It was the first Act to roll back a small part of the ERC. Included in the IIJA was wording that retroactively eliminated an employers’ ability to claim ERC credits after September 30, 2021 (eliminating Q4 qualification) as had been laid out in the ARP of 2021. Due to its timing, the IIJA impacted businesses who were monetizing the ERC in real time for Q4 of 2021 and created a headache for these taxpayers. The IIJA was the final change to ERC laws and created the final framework for eligibility: SDGR or FPSO qualification in Qs 2,3,&4 of 2020 and Qs 1,2&3 in 2021; and Recovery Startup Business qualification for Quarters 3 and 4 of 2021.\nDue to the nature of these acts, which made the ERC the most generous tax credit for SMB in history, enthusiasm threw fire to the wind and the IRS saw a gradually increasing influx of claims, both questionable and legitimate. “ERC fever” grew so rapidly, that bad actors began to take advantage of the confusing regulations and perplexed SMB leaders. Grandiose marketing and promotion gave way to a pop-up culture of overzealous ERC businesses and the IRS ran into a backlog for processing and auditing suspect claims. On September 14, 2023, the IRS issued\nIR-2023-169\n, a memo which announced a moratorium on processing new claims for the ERC through the end of the 2023 calendar year. In the memo, the IRS noted its concerns about improper claims and included advice on identifying the bad acting firms that could leave business owners in a bad situation if they were/are not prudent in vetting the tax advisors that they work with to claim the ERC. The memo also elicited more false information and overreactions from the public. Being a “moratorium” on processing new claims, the memo was a temporary cessation. Here are a few bullets on what the public gets wrong about IR-2023-169:\nIt doesn’t “end the ERC”\nIt is not an announcement of penalty for those who claimed the ERC\nIt does not advise taxpayers against filing for the ERC\nFor additional guidance on IR-2023-169, this\ncorresponding blog\n, written by the founder and CEO of Occams Advisory, covers the memo and how business owners can best navigate the changes it included.\nThe evolution of the ERC can be confusing, but it is empowering for SMB leaders to understand how we got here. As always, when dealing with tax refunds and the IRS, diligence and attention to detail is required. This is where Occams Advisory has a role to play. The ERC is an incredible and often overlooked opportunity for businesses, with a high-end potential value of up to $26,000 per employee per eligible employer. Again, exploration with a meticulous and reputable tax advisory firm is encouraged. The statute of limitations for claims for tax year 2020 expires on April 15, 2024, and for claims for tax year 2021 expires on April 15, 2025.

The rules on full time and full time equivalents are complex, and we are happy to dive into these calculations with you, even if you think you are too large.\nDid the IRS end the ERC?\nNo, the IRS did not end the ERC.

The days of placing an ad on the yellow pages and waiting for people to call are long gone.\nIn today’s digital-savvy world, where the rate of digital transformation adoption has accelerated post-Covid, digital marketing is not only the most cost-effective tool that small businesses can use for client acquisition and engagement, but it is also the ultimate way to build a perpetually healthy sales pipeline.\nSmall companies bore the brunt of the pandemic’s impact. The pandemic has had such a negative impact on them that there is no way for them to expand and take their firm to new heights.\nAll of the plans that small company owners devised for the future have proven ineffective and have brought their companies to a standstill.\nBut there is a glimmer of hope: as technology advances and consumers migrate to digital platforms, Digital Marketing is becoming increasingly important for small businesses.\nAccording to Martech Series, 97 percent of people conduct internet research before visiting a business in person.\nWhether it’s searching for a location and verifying business hours on Google or browsing through Facebook reviews, your online reputation and how it’s viewed matter. Furthermore, the more complete and interesting your internet presence, the more individuals your organization will reach.\nAmong the numerous benefits provided by digital marketing to small and medium-sized businesses are the following:\nIncrease in Customer Reach\nAudiences on digital platforms know no bounds, and there are no limits to how far you can extend your business.\nSmall company owners are taking advantage of this opportunity by expanding their operations via digital platforms in order to reach more clients.\nA website can reach clients anywhere in the world. Small companies that use digital marketing have a better chance of reaching new consumers in the region where they most likely supply their goods and services.\nCost-effectiveness\nDigital marketers with small and medium budgets must recognise that digital advertisements are less expensive than traditional marketing approaches. An ad in a relevant business journal can cost $500-$1500, and you have no clue how people would interpret it. Furthermore, your reach is restricted to the magazine’s readership.\nSmall and medium-sized businesses may reach thousands of people with digital marketing on a shoestring price, and Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google log every interaction and view of your statistics.\nAdopting change is the only way to succeed and combat the pandemic in this pandemic. Taking your firm to digital platforms is the key to greater profitability and survival even during a pandemic.\nSmall companies embrace change and move their operations to digital platforms. Adopting changes is difficult, but when you know these difficulties will lead to progress, you should never back down.\nUse Social Media to drive traffic\nSocial media not only provides an efficient platform for marketers to acquire referral traffic but also assists them in developing\nfavorable brand resonance\n. Addressing consumers’ concerns and pain points on social media platforms effectively and proactively help marketers earn some good word-of-mouth and work wonders for the online reputation management architecture of the businesses.\nYou may also organize your articles in the form of a “content calendar” to keep your target audience groups interested and engaged by publishing consistent and informative information on a regular basis.\nInfluencer Marketing\nMarketers may use influencers to interact with their social media followers and influence them with their opinions on a variety of issues. Audiences like and trust their favourite influencers, therefore it’s great if they hear about your business from individuals they know and trust.\nIn the following ways, an influencer may help your business grow:\nSet objectives for your influencer marketing efforts.\nTo design an effective campaign, you must first understand your objectives and target clientele.\nWhen seeking someone to promote your company, don’t hire an influencer for a one-time transaction. Create a successful relationship with your influencers before they can speak out in favor of your companies.\nGenerate more Jobs\nNot only are small companies thriving with digital marketing during a pandemic, but they are also creating jobs by reaching out to people through digital media.\nThey target potential consumers and produce more leads, which would appear to be unachievable without the use of digital marketing.\nSmall companies offer one-of-a-kind services that are close to their clients’ homes, as well as low-cost services. As a result, they are able to increase sales and reach a larger number of individuals.\nEven a small firm may thrive on digital platforms with the appropriate digital marketing tactics, tools, and strategy. Smaller firms have a greater opportunity to expand to the next level.\nIf business owners are unsure how to build up digital marketing campaigns on their own, they employ digital marketing companies. These companies assist businesses in going online on a low budget while still promising the finest exposure for their company.\n“This blog offers generic information.

In this blog post, we’ll explain what digital assets are, how they are taxed, and what the new IRS guidelines mean for reporting them.\nIntroduction\nDigital assets, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, their taxation has been a gray area for many taxpayers. The IRS has issued new guidelines to provide more clarity on how to report digital assets.\nWhat are Digital Assets?\nDigital assets are a type of virtual currency that are created and managed using advanced cryptography techniques. They are not physical assets, but rather exist only in digital form. Some examples of digital assets include cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and digital representations of physical assets like artwork or real estate.\nHow are Digital Assets Taxed?\nThe taxation of digital assets can be complex and depends on how they are used. In general, the IRS treats digital assets as property for tax purposes, meaning that any gains or losses are subject to capital gains tax. This means that if you sell a digital asset for more than you paid for it, you will owe taxes on the profit.\nIRS Guidelines for Reporting Digital Assets\nThe IRS has issued new guidelines for reporting digital assets for taxation purposes. Taxpayers must report their digital asset transactions on their tax returns, including the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital assets. The IRS has also clarified that taxpayers must report any income earned from mining digital assets, as well as any income earned from staking or receiving digital assets as a reward.\nReal-Life Scenario #1\nLet’s say you bought Bitcoin in 2022 for $10,000 and sold it in 2023 for $15,000. You would need to report the $5,000 gain on your tax return and pay capital gains tax on that amount.\nReal-Life Scenario #2\nNow let’s say you earned income from mining Bitcoin in 2023. You would need to report that income on your tax return, just as you would report income from any other source.\nConclusion\nThe IRS guidelines for reporting digital assets provide more clarity for taxpayers, but they also highlight the need for careful record-keeping and accurate reporting. By staying informed and working with a qualified tax professional, taxpayers can navigate the complex world of digital asset taxation.\nFAQs\nDo I need to report every digital asset transaction on my tax return?\nYes, taxpayers must report all digital asset transactions on their tax returns, including buying, selling, and exchanging digital assets.\nWhat happens if I fail to report my digital asset transactions?\nFailing to report digital asset transactions can result in penalties and additional taxes. It’s important to keep accurate records and report all transactions to avoid these consequences.\nHow do I determine the cost basis of my digital assets for tax purposes?\nThe cost basis of your digital assets is the original purchase price plus any fees or commissions. You’ll need to keep track of this information and report it accurately on your tax return.\nWhat if I receive digital assets as a gift or inheritance?\nGifts and inheritances of digital assets are subject to different tax rules than purchases or sales. It’s important to work with a qualified tax professional to understand how these transactions should be reported.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\nIRS.gov: Virtual Currencies (\nhttps://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/virtual-currencies\n)\nForbes: IRS Offers More Clarity On Tax Treatment Of Cryptocurrency Hard Forks And Airdrops (\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/03/21/irs-offers-more-clarity-on-tax-treatment-of-cryptocurrency-hard-forks-and-airdrops/?sh=4f9d8bfa764f\n)\nInvestopedia: How Are Cryptocurrencies Taxed in the US?

They either acquire all available shares at a price determined by their experts and resell them to the general public, or they sell shares on behalf of the issuer and receive a commission on each share sold.\nInvestment banking is one of the most complicated financial systems on the planet. They are used for a variety of purposes and commercial concerns. They offer a variety of financial services, including\nproprietary trading\n(where they trade securities for their own accounts), mergers and acquisitions advisory (where they assist companies in M&As), leveraged finance (where they lend money to companies to buy assets and settle acquisitions), and restructuring (where they improve company structures to make them more efficient).\nLet’s look at how an investment bank makes money by advising on acquisitions.\nConsider the case of business ABC purchasing XYZ. ABC is unsure how much business XYZ is truly worth and what the long-term income, cost, and other advantages will be. In this situation, the investment bank will conduct due diligence to evaluate the company’s worth, close the sale by assisting ABC in the preparation of relevant paperwork and advise it on the best time to close the deal.\nActivate Your Savings\nIt’s no secret that the economy’s manufacturing sector is usually short on cash. This means that businesses desire to construct factories, plants, and offices but lack the financial resources to do so. The household sector, on the other hand, has additional savings. Every person saves a little portion of their earnings. They are unable to invest their money profitably on their own. They have no choice except to leave their money uninvested. When they pool their resources, however, the resulting pool is large enough to support these businesses. As a result, investment banks’ primary goal is to mobilize savings and improve company performance.\nWith the passage of time, national boundaries have begun to blur. Regardless of geographical boundaries, the financial sector has become more interconnected. This has also created several opportunities for investment banks. People’s savings are being channelled not merely across different industries, but also across different enterprises. As a result, we see a lot of firms using foreign financial markets to raise funds.\nInvestment banking plays a critical part in the economy’s expansion. This is due to the fact that they allow the household sector to get the best potential return on their investment. At the same time, they make it possible for the industrial sector to get low-cost financing.\nCommercial banks vs. investment banks\nInvestment banks do not act alone in capital intermediation. Commercial banks also perform this service. This is why many individuals are perplexed by the distinction between the two. The operations of the two institutions are actually separated by a very narrow line.\nTo begin with, commercial banks only offer\ndebt financing\n. They also provide debt financing that is short and medium-term in nature. Investment banks, on the other hand, provide both stock and debt financing. They provide a broader variety of loans, ranging from extremely short-term to extremely long-term.\nSecond, commercial banks become the proprietors of the cash they lend. This means that if the loan they took is not repaid, commercial banks will be held liable. Investment banks, on the other hand, act as pure-play agents. They make sure that lenders and borrowers are on the same page. They do not, however, claim ownership of the funds. As a result, if any of the loans turn out to be faulty, the investment bankers have no responsibility. Simply put, they work on a commission basis.\nIn many areas of the globe, the same institutions are prohibited from engaging in both commercial and investment banking operations.\nInvestment banks also engage in a variety of other businesses.\nInvestment banks also engage in a variety of other businesses. All of these efforts are ultimately connected to capital raising.\nMany investors, for example, now invest in stock shares all around the world. This is why many investment banks have stock research desks that supply these investors with thorough buy-side and sell-side information. Many mutual funds and credit rating organizations are involved in this sector of investment banking.\nIn addition, the capital being raised is frequently in a foreign currency. This necessitates investment banks’ hedging of currency and other risks. Derivative instruments can be used to accomplish this. For such derivatives, investment banks provide over-the-counter services. Investment banks serve as agents in this situation. If one party wants to sell a certain currency, they utilize their network to find a counterparty who wants to purchase it. They deal in complicated contracts like futures and swaps, which they purchase and sell.\nThey also assist a firm in issuing securities. They underwrite the issuance of shares in this way. As a result, if the shares are not sold to the general public at a particular price point, investment banks will buy them. This allows the issuing firm to be confident that its securities will be able to be sold. They may then concentrate on their primary business.\nIn the end, investment banks are permitted to engage in any activity that is directly or indirectly linked to capital raising. Many of their operations overlap with those of other financial institutions. However, these services are frequently provided as a package to customers, which is why they use investment banks for some of these services.\n” This blog offers generic information.

Usually, an expanding business would grow revenue and improve its position in the industry. Development is not a precisely defined notion, though. We'll discuss\nwhat market development is in this article as well as why it is important for small businesses.\nWhat is growth in business?\nOne that is developing in one or more ways is a rising business. To measure development, there is no single metric used. Instead, to demonstrate an organisation is growing, many data points should be illustrated. They include:\n*Profits\n*Sale\n*Worth of business\n*Benefits\n*Amount of workers\n*Amount of clients\nIn some of these metrics, companies will expand, but not in others. For instance, if the increases are triggered by current consumers spending more, sales will rise without an increase in customers. A statistic can\nstill rise when another decreases; if market growth were brought on by a reduction in the price of the commodity, the net income of a company will also decrease.\nThis means it can be tough to identify development. Those looking to expand their organisation should look at their company targets in order to determine the growth indicators that they deem essential.\nThis may mean doing all they can to maximise the overall number of clients for certain ambitious start-ups, even though they make a big loss in the early growth stages. However, to ensure more capital is\nflowing in to help offset expenses, most firms will benefit from slowly growing revenue and sales.\nFor a small company, why is business growth important?\nIt's critical that all businesses experience growth. The type of growth expected, however, would depend on the stage of growth at which the organisation is.\nIn order to secure their place in the market and rapidly get to a size that is big enough to pull in adequate sales to offset expenses and continue to make a profit, start-ups typically need to expand.\nThere's no need for established firms to expand just as rapidly. They will, though, also want to make sure their metrics are moving in the right direction. Even if revenue and sales remain the same, a rise in\nprofitability, induced by sales process efficiencies, may help a healthy organization develop liquidity to defend against potential danger.\nWhat are the key factors of growth for business?\nBusinesses should not grow alone. If a business is trying to achieve organic growth, processes would have to be placed in place to accelerate growth. Here are the variables that can make an organization expand.\nIndividuals with the urge and potential to accelerate development\nThe most critical aspect is to have individuals striving to rise at the head of the group. The driving force behind the expansion of the organisation could be a growth-oriented owner. In addition, other\nmanagement and personnel require both the encouragement and the experience to enable a business to thrive.\nA roadmap that prioritises development\nAlthough individuals are the driving force behind success, a plan has to be in place that will propel the organisation forward. This may be about taking in more buyers, launching more merchandise, or exploring\nnew markets.\nThe requisite processes and resources to promote growth\nProcesses need to be placed in place to encourage growth once the business has employees who want to expand and a plan that prioritises progress. This may include the introduction of automation tools that\nmakes operations more productive or ensuring that warehouses are big enough to hold the supply that would be expected if a business grows.\nSufficient finance to make the above feasible\nThe above variables all have one thing in common, which includes the introduction of financing. They would fail to produce success if an owner does not have the resources available to make the necessary hires, invest in the product, or enforce processes.\n#BusinessGrowth #SmallBusiness #SufficientFinance #Sales #Profits\nArticle Credits –\nact.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nOccams ERC Audit Advisory: Mitigating Risks and Ensuring Com...\nThe Employee Retention Credit (ERC) has been a lifeline for many businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this comprehensive guide, we will provide you with essential information, effective strategies, and real-life examples to help you navigate the journey of paying off credit card debt successfully.

However, with the right knowledge and strategies, you can take control of your finances and pay off your credit card debt. This comprehensive guide provides valuable insights, expert tips, and practical steps to help you eliminate credit card debt and achieve financial freedom.\nUnderstanding Credit Card Debt\nBefore diving into the debt payoff process, it’s important to understand the nature of credit card debt. Learn about interest rates, minimum payments, and how revolving credit works. Familiarize yourself with common credit card terms to make informed decisions regarding your debt.\nAssessing Your Debt Situation\nThe first step towards paying off credit card debt is to assess your current financial situation. Take inventory of your credit card balances, interest rates, and monthly payments. Evaluate your income, expenses, and discretionary spending. This assessment will provide a clear picture of your debt load and help you determine the most effective debt repayment strategy.\nCreating a Debt Repayment Plan\nDeveloping a well-defined debt repayment plan is crucial for success. Consider various methods, such as the debt snowball or debt avalanche approach, to determine which one suits your needs best. Set achievable goals, establish a timeline, and allocate extra funds towards debt repayment. This plan will serve as your roadmap to becoming debt-free.\nExploring Debt Consolidation Options\nDebt consolidation can be a viable option to simplify your debt repayment and potentially lower your interest rates. Research different debt consolidation methods, such as balance transfers or personal loans. Understand the benefits, risks, and eligibility criteria associated with each option before making a decision.\nImplementing Effective Debt Repayment Strategies\nTo make significant progress in paying off credit card debt, implement effective debt repayment strategies. Explore tactics like the “snowflake method,” where you make small additional payments whenever possible, or the “zero-sum budgeting” approach, where you allocate every dollar towards a specific purpose. Find the strategies that resonate with you and align with your financial goals.\nReal-Life Scenarios: Successful Credit Card Debt Payoff\n1. Laura’s Story: Laura was drowning in credit card debt, juggling multiple high-interest cards and struggling to make minimum payments. She decided to take control of her finances and create a debt repayment plan. By cutting back on unnecessary expenses, increasing her income through a side job, and prioritizing debt repayment, Laura successfully paid off her credit card debt within three years. Her story demonstrates that determination and a solid repayment plan can lead to debt freedom.\n2. Mark and Sarah’s Story: Mark and Sarah faced mounting credit card debt due to unexpected medical expenses. They sought assistance from a nonprofit credit counseling agency. Through a debt management plan, they consolidated their credit card debts into a single monthly payment with reduced interest rates. With the support of their credit counselor and disciplined budgeting, Mark and Sarah paid off their credit card debt within five years.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nFAQs\nShould I pay off my credit card with the highest interest rate first?\nIt depends on your preferred debt payoff strategy. While focusing on the highest interest rate card can save you more money in the long run, some people find motivation in paying off smaller debts first. Choose a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and keeps you motivated.\nCan I negotiate with credit card companies to reduce my debt?\nIt’s possible to negotiate with credit card companies to reduce your debt or negotiate for lower interest rates. However, success may vary, and it’s recommended to seek professional assistance, such as credit counseling services, for guidance.\nWill paying off credit card debt improve my credit score?\nPaying off credit card debt can positively impact your credit score. It reduces your credit utilization ratio and demonstrates responsible financial behavior. However, other factors also influence your credit score, such as payment history and the length of your credit history.\nShould I close credit card accounts after paying off the debt?\nClosing credit card accounts after paying off the debt is a personal decision. It may affect your credit utilization ratio and potentially impact your credit score. Consider keeping accounts open with no balance to maintain a healthy credit history.\nRelated Topic Blog\nSynergy In Finance With The Collaboration Of Human Intellige...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Benefits of AI in Finance Challenges to be considered Conclusion    Introduction The finance world is changing at a rapid pace with new technologies...\nRead More\nFed Raises Interest Rates by 0.75% Point for Third Straight...\nThe Federal Reserve approved a third-consecutive 0.75 percentage point rise Wednesday.

The rogue $2,416 should be a rounding error, yet it’s the pebble in your shoe that turns a quiet weekend into another reconciliation marathon. Most small-to-mid-size finance teams know that scene by heart. That’s why the arrival of Microsoft Copilot for Finance feels less like a shiny new gadget and more like the first fresh breeze in a very long, very stuffy room.\nWhat’s changing: AI has moved inside the spreadsheet\nFor years, “AI in finance” sounded like keynote fantasy, interesting, maybe, but safely out on the horizon. Copilot changes that by pulling up a chair inside Excel and Outlook, right where your team already lives. It reads ledgers, pivots, and those hastily built helper sheets, then starts making suggestions ordinary humans actually want:\n“These vendor payments don’t line up with the bank feed.”\n“Travel looks high this month, want a quick breakdown?”\n“Here’s a first-draft variance memo for your board deck.”\nMicrosoft’s chief Satya Nadella recently told Build’s audience, “Copilot will be as significant to daily work as the first PC.” Big words, but the shift is practical: instead of forcing you to learn yet another platform, Copilot learns you.\nHow it works: less key-mashing, more sense-making\nThink of Copilot as a colleague who’s excellent at grunt work and politely chatty about what it finds. Drop two data sets into Excel, say, an ERP export and a bank statement, and Copilot proposes a reconciliation, color-codes the mismatches, and drafts a short narrative you can paste straight into your close package. Open Outlook, and the same assistant sees an email about an overdue invoice, fetches the ledger entry, attaches backup, and drafts a reply before you’ve finished reading.\nUnder the hood, Copilot leans on Microsoft’s GPT-4o model wrapped in the same security bubble that guards the rest of Microsoft 365. If your data lives in Dynamics 365 or SAP, the connector is turnkey; if it lives in QuickBooks, Sage, or a pile of CSVs, Power Automate, and a growing shelf of low-code adapters bridge the gap. In short: if it can land in a table, Copilot can probably read it.\nLet’s imagine a 20-person CPA practice, we’ll call them Prairie Ledger, serving construction and dental clients across the Midwest. Here’s what could change in their first quarter with Copilot:\nCredit-card reconciliations that once ate forty staff-hours a month become a ten-minute automated run. The assistant matches the lion’s share of transactions in minutes, pinpoints the outliers, and hands a color-coded cleanup list to a junior.\nBudget-versus-actual commentary no longer starts with a blinking cursor and an empty page. Copilot drafts the first pass (“Travel rose 17 percent thanks to Project Omega site visits”), managers add nuance, and the team still heads home on time.\nMonth-end that swells from five to nine days finally slips back toward that single-digit close. With reconciliations squared by Day 2 and variance notes drafted by Day 3, partners review earlier, freeing up time for advisory work, valuation models, cash-flow forecasts, M&A prep, projects clients happily pay a premium for.\nIf that sounds dreamy, consider the real-life breadcrumb trail already out there.\nInsight Enterprises reported a 93 percent\nCopilot adoption rate and measurable productivity bumps across finance, HR, and sales after only a few months of rollout. Bennie Lewis of Assurance Dimensions (one of the firms rolled up by Crete Professionals Alliance) says the\nAI tools his team now uses for audit memos\nare “saving us entire days each quarter, time we can push into client advisory work.”\nMapping the first three months: where to lean in, where to pump the brakes\nYou don’t need a color-coded Gantt chart tattooed on the conference-room wall, but momentum matters. Most early adopters echo five guiding principles:\nSandbox first. Spin up a separate Microsoft 365 tenant, especially if you handle healthcare or payroll data, so experiments stay quarantined until you trust the outputs.\nReconciliations before rocket science. They’re repeatable, measurable, and politically safe. If Copilot proves it can match 95 percent of items without human help, confidence soars.\nNarrative after numbers. Budget commentary dazzles only if the figures underneath are solid. Let the assistant write memos once reconciliations pass muster.\nEmail drafting last. Outlook integration is magical, but turn it on only after staff believes in Copilot’s math. Otherwise the “wow” factor gets drowned in healthy skepticism.\nSmall scope, loud metrics. Track three numbers, recon time, response lag on AR emails, review comments per variance memo, weekly. Early wins energize a rollout faster than a 47-row KPI spreadsheet.\nFollow that rhythm and, by the 90-day mark, you know whether Copilot is saving money, saving weekends, or just saving IT another dashboard to maintain. Scale cautiously if the answer is “all three.”\nGuardrails auditors respect: what must happen, and what must never\nEvery new tool invites scrutiny, and finance leaders know the drill. The firms having smooth rides keep five ideas on repeat:\nData stays home until it earns a passport. Keep files in the sandbox until sign-off, and lock Microsoft’s temp-storage region to your jurisdiction.\nTranscripts are your friend. Copilot logs prompts and answers; pull the report monthly and stash it in the audit folder.\nNo entry without human eyes. Copilot may propose a journal line, but an accountant must click “approve.” It’s the difference between assistive tech and a runaway bot.\nStrip personal identifiers on the way in. Social-security numbers, patient IDs, mask them before ingestion. Power Query handles it in seconds; compliance teams sleep easier.\nTreat rollout like a culture shift, not a software install. Celebrate the hours saved, then retrain staff to use those hours on advisory work clients value more than clerical heroics.\nGet those basics right and an auditor’s curious glance becomes a nod, and maybe a quiet note to try the tool at their own firm.\nLate, night spreadsheets don’t have to define your month, end anymore. Copilot for Finance sits right inside tools your team already trusts, turning cut and paste drudgery into decision, ready insight with a handful of prompts.\nEarly adopters, the Insight, style corporate teams, the Crete, backed audit shops, are closing books sooner, replying to client emails in real time, and trading rescued hours for higher, margin advisory projects.\nIf reclaiming those hours sounds good, let’s talk. At Occams, we believe everything is going to be AI native, that is the future we are presently in. Together we can point the robots toward the busywork, lift your people into the work that really counts, and maybe, just maybe, keep your Saturday sacred again.\nLocation: United States of America\nMedia Contact: Harsh Golani\nContact Details:\nmarketing@occamsadvisory.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nRaising capital: Each investor needs to know three things\nYou want a lot of information on how the investment can be spent when you are an investor being approached to provide a growing corporation with millions of dollars in cash.

Occams works with its clients in identifying the growth drivers, laying out the roadmap, executing the strategy and reviewing it periodically for course correction. Business growth, however, sometimes necessitates buying complimenting businesses and divesting the ones that are adding no more value to the core business. We work with our clients to make decisions regarding acquisitions and\ndivestures\n. Successful deals are founded upon an investment philosophy predicated upon a business’ growth needs. An acquisition needs to be aligned with an organization’s growth strategy. Strategic due diligence is a forward-looking process that helps create value through investigation of targets with a focus on what is really important. Acquirers that focus on smaller deals tend to outperform those doing larger deals. We consider M&A as an extension of our client’s growth strategy where the primary focus is not on growing faster, but to excel at their core competency. We help our clients invest in their core and expand into highly related businesses that reinforce their core. To maximize a business’s exit value, a divestiture needs to be carefully orchestrated. To be successful in this process, a business must articulate its growth agenda. Such an agenda will spell out the decision regarding where to invest and where to divest. Once a business has clarity regarding its growth agenda, it needs to assess whether it can separate the businesses to be divested, and sketch out a separation roadmap. We help our clients evaluate divestiture options (outright sale, spin-off etc.). Occams also works with its clients in divestiture preparation, articulating a compelling rationale for buyers and creating the road map of the details of the separation. This includes identifying the right valuation range. Finally, we work with our clients to screen buyers, conduct reverse due diligence and create a buyer approach\nGo to Market strategy\nThe most effective way to succeed in a market is to provide the customers what they are looking for. Listening to potential customers, anticipating their needs and proactively providing easy-to-use solutions for their problems ensures immediate success. At Occams we help our clients do that. We also help them in analyzing the competitive landscape and discovering new market opportunities. This enables our clients build an effective go-to-market strategy, create a strategic marketing plan and seize potential prospects. Occams Advisory marketing solutions provides powerful and easy-to-use solutions to help our clients address their business challenges.\nOrganization\nCreating and delivering upon a successful organization-wide strategy requires a strong strategic foundation. Such a foundation ought to be based on a rigorous and thorough evaluation of all the alternatives. It should entail a careful follow-through to create effective incentives and align them with optimal goals. We work for and with our clients to assess the eventual potential of the business. We believe that a sustainable growth proposition is possible only if our client knows what needs to be sustained for how long. At Occams we are acutely aware that not any two businesses are alike. Even for a single client, the strategy needed to succeed in one business or geography might not be adequate or effective in a different business or geography. We focus on understanding the unique nature of our client’s business so that we can brainstorm with our client to customize a strategy that will be effective where the client’s business is. This process involves analyzing the factors driving the business at root level and making decisions on how and where to play.

Just 5% of sales worldwide are made in cash, while 73% of transactions are made using debit, credit, eWallets, and prepaid cards.\nAlthough online acceptance of payment cards has many benefits, online handling of a credit card payment has several difficulties and risks. Let's look at some of the greatest dangers of paying by credit card online.\nTheft of Identities\nLink reliability is one of the main challenges with any form of online transaction. It is important to protect a wireless link when making purchases to deter an outside attacker from reading and accessing credit card data and using the data to capture the identity of the cardholder.\nThere can be no underestimation of the expense of a data leak. The estimated risk of a data loss for small companies in the US is $ 117,000, in addition to the bad coverage for an organisation that is struck by identity fraud. There are a number of forms in which payment processors employ technologies to protect clients. Online card data security safeguards should be offered by the payment processor, which minimises the chances of a data loss and benefits both retailers and cardholders. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are actively working to detect developments that continue to allow successful transactions to go through while avoiding potentially fraudulent transactions. When talking to card processors, please always ask about protection.\nCosts of Enforcement\nFormance with PCI mandates also includes the handling of an online credit card charge. These mandates are subject to any company that takes card payments, and non-compliance fines can be substantial.\nBased on the scale and complexity of an organisation, the commitment and expense associated in PCI enforcement vary. Knowing what your payment service does to help you understand and comply with PCI requirements is important, particularly for smaller online businesses. Any providers, such as\nEquiPay\n, provide robust services targeting both card data protection and enforcement. To learn what's open to you, reach out to your payment processor.\nThe experience with the customer\nTo ensure a fulfilled purchase, an optimal online consumer interface can benefit. Not only do you have to provide the payment options that your customers want, you need to ensure them that you are comfortable with their payment details. Show protection badges before accessing card data to give consumers a peace of mind.\nThe shopping cart experience is important and usually customers want choices. Enable shoppers to opt to register as a guest or check out. Registration makes shopping simple for returning customers who want to breeze to checkout, while guest checkout allows shoppers the ability to store personal data for multiple businesses. It would also help secure a fulfilled order by making it easier to locate coupon codes, delivery prices, and other things specific to their order.\nResources and Strategies\nWhat does your company need to excel in processing a credit card payment online and to reduce your risks? We offer a range of solutions and tools for online payments.

As a leading provider of Occams ERC Audit Advisory, we at Occams Advisory want to keep you informed and prepared.\nThe IRS Audit Program Ramps Up\nThe IRS has initiated an aggressive audit program to identify and address ineligible ERC claims. Our experience with two client audits highlights this focus. Both audits targeted Q3 of 2021, even though the credit hadn’t been paid yet. This suggests the IRS may revisit earlier quarters if discrepancies are found. Fortunately, for both our clients, the audits concluded successfully – one credit was paid, and the other is on its way.\nNavigating the Audit Process\nOur experience provides valuable insights:\nNew Auditors:\nThe auditors assigned to our clients were unfamiliar with the ERC program, indicating the IRS might be reassigning personnel from other areas.\nFocus on Calculations:\nBoth audits centered on verifying calculations for qualification and credit amounts. This data-driven approach simplifies the process for everyone involved.\nProfessionalism and Transparency:\nOur positive interactions with the auditors demonstrate an opportunity to collaborate in identifying and rectifying errors. We strongly encourage transparency throughout the process.\nVoluntary Disclosure Program: A Lifeline for Ineligible Claims\nThe IRS offers a Voluntary Disclosure Program for organizations that received ERC funds they may not have qualified for. By March 22nd, 2024, organizations can return 80% of the funds and avoid penalties, interest, and amended tax returns (except for non-profit organizations deducting payroll against UBI). This program allows organizations to rectify mistakes without facing harsher consequences from a potential audit.\nAlternatives for Withdrawing Unprocessed Applications\nThe IRS offers another option for organizations with unprocessed and un-audited ERC applications. A simple handwritten note stating “WITHDRAWN” on a copy of the 941X form, signed and dated, can be faxed to withdraw the application.\nThe Fall of ERC Service Providers and the Importance of Trustworthy Advisors\nThe recent news of a major ERC service provider laying off staff highlights the challenges within the industry. This company, known for charging hefty contingent fees, raises concerns about the quality of services offered. Choosing a trustworthy advisor like Occams Advisory is crucial.\nOccams ERC Audit Advisory: Your Partner in Risk Management\nThe Occams ERC Audit Advisory goes beyond simply filing claims. We leverage our expertise in risk management to proactively identify and address potential issues. Our services encompass:\nLeading Risk Management Strategies:\nWe deploy robust processes to minimize the risk of ineligible claims or incorrect claim amounts.\nERC Claim Expertise:\nOur team possesses in-depth knowledge of the ERC program and its regulations.\nAudit Risk Management:\nWe guide clients through every stage of the audit process, from initial contact to potential U.S. Tax Court petition.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMy business received ERC funds, but I'm unsure if we were truly eligible. What should I do?\nIf you have concerns about your eligibility, act quickly. The IRS Voluntary Disclosure Program allows you to return 80% of the funds and avoid penalties by March 22nd, 2024. Contact Occams Advisory to discuss your situation and explore your options.\nThe IRS is auditing my ERC claim. What can I expect?\nOur experience suggests the IRS may be assigning new auditors unfamiliar with the program. The focus will likely be on verifying calculations for qualification and credit amounts. Transparency and clear communication are key. Occams Advisory can guide you through the audit process.\nI have an unprocessed ERC application I want to withdraw. How do I do that?\nSimply write “WITHDRAWN” on a copy of your 941X form, sign and date it, and fax it to the IRS.\nWhat makes Occams Advisory different from other ERC service providers?\nOccams Advisory goes beyond just filing claims. We take a risk-management approach, proactively identifying potential issues and ensuring your claim adheres to regulations. Our team has in-depth knowledge of the ERC program and can support you throughout the entire process, including potential audits.\nConclusion:\nDon’t Wait Until It’s Too Late\nWith the March 22nd Voluntary Disclosure Program deadline approaching and the IRS pursuing audits, it’s critical to act. Contact Occams Advisory today to discuss your specific situation and explore how our Occams ERC Audit Advisory services can help you navigate the complexities of the ERC program.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation :\nClick here\nSources and Citations:\n1: IRS Website – Employee Retention Credit\nThis is the official IRS webpage for the ERC program.

In a poor economy, though, they may be the kiss of death.\nIf you're having trouble coming up with money to cover your bills on time because of the crisis, these four fast fixes for cash flow issues should help.\n1. Cut Out Unnecessary Business Costs\nGet your bank accounts out. Let your credit card bills out of the drawer. What are some of the costs that you've noticed?\nLook at regular monthly costs that you should slash to get the best return on investment.\nEvery company usually has several business tool subscriptions, email subscriptions, and app subscriptions.\nEvery company usually has several business tool subscriptions, email subscriptions, and app subscriptions.\nAnd I'm willing to bet that at least 5% to 15% of them are no longer in use or fulfilling their original intent. Identify them and cancel them as soon as possible.\nThis simple exercise will boost your cash flow and save you thousands of dollars per year.\nAnother simple way to save money is to swap costly facilities with less expensive ones. Replace your landline phone with a paying Skype account, for example. Alternatively, find a free open source alternative to a paying solution.\nYou'll be surprised by how many fine, inexpensive programmes are available until you start looking. (If you need assistance getting started, simply ask your social network.)\n2. Increase the speed at which you invoice and decrease the speed at which you pay your bills.\nWhen money is going out quicker than it is coming in, you must do everything possible to halt the process. And, in the end, you want the money to run out faster than it comes in.\nOne simple way to accomplish this is to obtain invoices more quickly and then “float” the currency.\nSo, for example:\nSee if you can get your customers to pay you faster if you usually invoice on Net 30 terms. Give them a slight discount whether they pay in full up front or within a shorter period of time, such as 14 days.\nYour cash balance would be higher if you get paid quickly.\nThe process's second step is to keep your capital for as long as possible. As a result, you can try to postpone paying your vendors.\nFor a single invoice, you can request conditions or an extension. If you don't want to haggle with sellers, you might pay with a credit card.\nIf you pay with a credit card, you will be given an additional 25-30 days to pay. (Just make sure you have enough cash by the end of the billing period to pay off the balance.)\n3. Outsource tasks that aren't the most efficient or productive use of your time.\nYou're adding to the cash flow issues if you're doing data entry while you should be doing jobs worth $1,000 per hour.\nIf you're still stuck doing menial work in your company, you'll never have time to work on it.\nYou must devote 100% of your time to activities that increase the monetary worth of your talents. Every job that does not include the highest-value ability set should be delegated to a trustworthy freelancer.\nIf you're a lone entrepreneur, for example, you could employ a Virtual Assistant (VA) to help you with some of the more boring and time-consuming activities you face on a daily basis.\nYou may even hire a firm to track calls, take messages, and schedule meetings for you. This alone could save you a couple of hours per week, allowing you to focus on activities that produce more sales and benefit.\n4. Don't Let a Successful Month Destroy Your Cash Flow\nIf you've ever had a really successful month of industry, you know how thrilling it can be. You know how enticing it is to go out and buy the pricey item you've had your eye on.\nHere's some advice: don't buy that item.\nHave your feelings under control.\nWhen times are healthy, put some money together so you can conveniently weather any bad months that may (or may not) occur in the future.\nRegrettably, this recommendation is seldom practiced. Take a look at the people in charge of major product releases. They do dumb stuff with their newfound wealth, such as buy six-figure luxury sports cars and bachelor pads with 10,000 square feet.\nThis is a big blunder.\nSince a good month does not equate to a good year. Past earnings are no promise of potential profits. Today's economic trends are not always those of tomorrow. etc., etc.\nIf you become financially over-committed in your personal life, your company will suffer easily.\nThe most prosperous businessmen (and women) I've met are those who are able to give up a luxurious lifestyle in order to make wise investments to keep their companies going smoothly.\nSome of the wealthiest people are perhaps among the most frugal.\nEntrepreneurs who run lean operations — even though cash flow is strong — are the ones who endure difficult times and stay in their respective markets for a long time.\nThese four\nenterprise optimization techniques\nshould be followed… Make a conscious effort to incorporate them into your business… and you'll be able to solve the cash flow issues easily.\nArticle Credits –\nryanhealy.com\n#BusinessExpenses #CashFlow #FasterInvoice #OutsourceTasks\nRelated Topic Blog\nConquering Complexities: How Financial Advisory and Transact...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Real-Life Scenarios  Frequently Asked Questions Conclusion  Sources and Citations Introduction In the high-stakes world of finance, navigating major...\nRead More\nThe Fiat Standard vs. The Bitcoin Standard: A Tale of Two Mo...\nA deep dive into fiat’s debt-based fragility versus Bitcoin’s energy-driven resilience, and what each system reveals about the future of money.

Employee wellness programs not only aim to improve the overall health of team members but also come with a silver lining for employers in the form of tax benefits. Dive into this blog to uncover the myriad benefits of implementing a wellness program in your organization.\nUnderstanding Employee Wellness Programs\nEmployee wellness programs are structured initiatives that focus on enhancing the holistic well-being of employees. These initiatives provide resources catering to physical, mental, and emotional health. When employees are healthier and less stressed, they are invariably more productive, leading to a decrease in absenteeism and disruptions in daily tasks. Moreover, a positive work environment, fostered by wellness programs, boosts employee engagement and job satisfaction.\nThe Different Facets of Employee Wellness Programs\nWhile wellness programs have a broad spectrum, they can be primarily classified into:\nPhysical Wellness Programs\n: These emphasize promoting and supporting physical health. By encouraging healthy lifestyle habits and regular physical activities, such programs play a pivotal role in ensuring the physical well-being of employees.\nMental and Emotional Wellness Programs\n: Mental health is equally crucial. These programs offer counseling services, stress-relief activities, and resources to help employees manage their mental and emotional well-being.\nFinancial Wellness Programs\n: Addressing employees’\nfinancial health\n, these programs educate them about budgeting, investments, and financial planning.\nReaping the Financial Benefits\nThe implementation of wellness programs doesn’t just contribute to the well-being of employees; it also impacts the bottom line positively. The two main financial advantages include:\nCost Savings\n: Healthier employees lead to reduced healthcare expenses, lesser absenteeism, and heightened productivity.\nROI for Wellness Programs\n: By comparing the costs of implementing the program against the long-term financial benefits, organizations can witness a significant return on investment.\nMaximizing Your Tax Benefits\nTo harness the full potential of tax benefits from wellness programs, it’s essential to:\nStay Updated with IRS Regulations\n: Being well-acquainted with IRS guidelines, especially IRC Section 125, can help in formulating compliant wellness programs.\nEngage Employees Effectively\n: Communication is key. By offering incentives, rewards, and involving leadership teams, you can ensure higher participation rates.\nMeasure and Evaluate Regularly\n: Establishing clear metrics and conducting regular ROI analyses can help in tweaking the program for maximum benefits.\nConclusion\nEmployee wellness programs offer a dual benefit. They ensure the overall well-being of employees and provide substantial financial and tax advantages for organizations. By investing in such programs, businesses pave the way for a healthier, more productive workforce, ensuring long-term success.

Recession can affect small businesses in significant ways, from decreased sales to cash flow problems. But there are steps you can take to minimize the impact of a recession on your business. Here are some expert tips from Occam’s Advisory on how to prepare your small business for a recession.\nUnderstanding the Impact of a Recession on Small Businesses\nA recession is a period of economic decline characterized by a decrease in GDP, rising unemployment rates, and a reduction in consumer spending. Small businesses can be particularly vulnerable during a recession, as they may have limited resources and a smaller customer base. During a recession, small businesses may experience:\nReduced sales: Consumers may cut back on spending during a recession, leading to lower sales for small businesses.\nCash flow problems: Reduced sales can lead to cash flow problems for small businesses, making it difficult to pay bills and make investments.\nIncreased competition: In a recession, small businesses may face increased competition from larger businesses that have more resources and can offer lower prices.\nTips for Preparing Your Small Business for a Recession\nCreate a Financial Plan: It’s important to have a financial plan in place before a recession hits. This should include a budget that takes into account reduced sales and cash flow problems. You should also consider securing a line of credit or other financing options in case you need to make investments during a recession.\nDiversify Your Products or Services: Diversifying your products or services can help protect your business during a recession. Consider offering complementary products or services that appeal to a wider audience.\nFocus on Customer Retention: During a recession, it’s important to retain existing customers. Offer loyalty programs, discounts, or other incentives to encourage repeat business.\nCut Costs Where Possible: Cutting costs can help you weather a recession. Consider reducing expenses such as rent, utilities, or marketing costs. You may also need to consider reducing staff or hours worked.\nReal-Life Scenarios of Small Businesses Surviving a Recession\nA small clothing boutique in a tourist town was struggling to make ends meet during a recession. To survive, the owner diversified their product offerings and started selling more casual clothing items. They also launched an e-commerce site to reach a wider audience. These changes helped the business stay afloat during tough economic times.\nA family-owned restaurant faced reduced sales during a recession. To retain customers, they offered a loyalty program that rewarded frequent diners with discounts and free meals. They also cut costs by reducing staff hours and implementing energy-efficient equipment. These measures helped the restaurant stay in business during the recession.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\n“How to Prepare Your Business for a Recession” by Emily Starbuck Crone, NerdWallet.

Most want to be investment bankers, attracted by these careers promising high-profile and handsome wages. What are investment bankers doing then?\nWhat Bankers of Investment Do ?\nEssentially, corporate finance advisors are investment bankers.\nFollowing the financial crash of 2007-08, Wall Street drew the ire of the world, and its position in the crisis contributed to increased oversight and control of the financial industry. The recession, which came to a head in Sept. 2008 after investment firm Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, revealed the Wall Street underbelly.\nBut while as a result, the lustre of becoming a so-called Wall Street master of the universe has been somewhat tarnished, Wall Street careers still remain a magnet for top graduates.\nThe Investment Banker's Job\nInstead of working individually with private clients, the investment banker operates in a financial markets consulting capacity to businesses and governments. Investment bankers support their clients in raising capital markets funds, offering numerous financial consulting services, and assisting in mergers and acquisitions operations.\nTherefore, when the financial markets are doing well, investment bankers appear to do well because all the operations they perform will produce more money.\nFinance Structure\nIf a large corporation wishes to construct a factory and needs to issue bond financing to fund its expansion, it can obtain an investment banker's assistance. Similarly, a government can collaborate with an investment banker to issue bonds to raise capital if it wants to fund the development of an airport, highway or other major municipal project.\nIn such a scenario, the investment banker will schedule the issuing of the bond, pricing the issuance of the bond so that there is ample interest for the bonds, negotiating with the borrower to handle the U.S. Necessary documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue the bonds and assist in selling the bonds.\nWhen it comes to coordinating equity capital, the investment banker still plays a part. Suppose a business believes that it wants more capital to expand and decides to collect the money by heading in for an initial public offering, or IPO. A prospectus outlining the terms of the bid and the risks it entails will be put together by an investment manager, overseeing the issuance process with the SEC, and helping to price the deal. The shares need to be priced just fine. The public will not be interested in purchasing them if they are priced too high. The investment banker could be leaving some money on the table that he or she may have made for the customer if they are priced too low.\nDeals to Underwrite\nUsually, investment bankers often conduct the signing of agreements while arranging the funding of the financial markets for their customers. This suggests that by purchasing the shares from the issuers and selling them to the public or retail investors, they handle the risk implicit in the process. Investment bankers purchase the shares at a single price and then apply the sale price to a discount and thereby make a return that compensates for the risk they take on. The underwriting distribution is this spread. A lead investment banker usually deals with a group of investment bankers, called a\nsyndicate\n, to subscribe to a problem such that the risk is divided among them.\nOften in selling the transactions, the underwriter simply serves as a go-between and takes the utmost attempt to sell the shares, but does not carry on the burden of subscribing. In this situation, investment bankers have the option to sell shares and get paid for the exact sum of securities they sell, on a commission basis.\nPlacements for Private\nInstead of carrying on the cost of a stock offering, investment bankers often assist their clients by private placements to collect money. They might for example, put bonds with an institutional investor, such as an insurance firm or a pension fund, on sale. This is typically an easier way to collect funds and there is no need to apply with the SEC for this kind of deal.\nThe state finds institutional investors to be more mature than individual investors, because there are less private placement regulations.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nAnother field in which investment bankers play a part is where a business is trying to acquire another business. An investment banker provides guidance, including the price of the bid, about how the business can go through the acquisition. This requires valuing the targeted market and having a price that reflects its worth. Companies placing themselves up for sale on the other side of the deal will require investment bankers to determine asking rates and proposals. Fusions and acquisitions may also entail lengthy wars.\nConflict Of Interest\nThey also drawn scrutiny even as investment bankers help grease the gears of financial markets. For one after investment bankers were advised to compel analysts to favourably score stocks to appease their customers to generate investment banking revenue, the credibility of Wall Street's stock analysis has come into question. The SEC approved guidelines to deal with certain conflicts of interest between the investment banking activity of a corporation and its equity analysis operations.\nAnother conflict of interest can arise as investment bankers who have access to proprietary customer details relating to their company and prospects are willing to pass on information to the traders of their company. When dealing with customers who don't have the same details, traders will use this insider information to an unfair benefit.\nAbout the bottom line\nInvestment bankers play a part in helping their customers collect money in a capitalist environment to fund different operations and expand their businesses. They are\nfinancial advice intermediaries\nthat assist and assign pricing resources to multiple purposes.\nWhile this practise helps grease the gears of capitalism, since there is some concern that they are paying too well in comparison to the services they offer, the position of investment bankers has been scrutinised.\nArticle Credits –\ninvestopedia.com\n#Bankers #Investments #FinanceStructure #UnderwriteDeals #Mergers #Acquisitions\nRelated Topic Blog\nOccams ERC Audit Advisory: Mitigating Risks and Ensuring Com...\nThe Employee Retention Credit (ERC) has been a lifeline for many businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Enhancing Trust Through Data Transparency\n▷\n5. Tangible Benefits of AI in Client Relations\n▷\nThe Strategic Path Forward\n▷\nFinal Thoughts: The Future Is Personal, Predictive, and Proactive\nIntroduction\nIn today’s ultra-competitive market, where businesses are often offering similar products or services, one thing increasingly sets companies apart — the client experience. Gone are the days when quality and price alone could guarantee customer loyalty. In 2025, success lies in delivering exceptional, personalized, and seamless interactions at every touchpoint. And to achieve that, forward-thinking businesses are embracing artificial intelligence (AI) not just for efficiency — but to completely transform the way they serve, retain, and grow their client base.\nWe are no longer asking if AI should be part of your client experience strategy. The question now is how well you’re using it.\nCustomer Experience: The New Competitive Advantage\n“Delivering an exceptional customer experience is now essential for companies of every kind, regardless of size or sector.”\nIn the past, customer service was reactive — something that happened when a client reached out with a question or complaint. But AI has turned the model upside down. It enables businesses to proactively understand client needs, tailor communications, and identify friction points before they escalate. More importantly, AI helps us enhance — not replace — the human connection.\nWith AI, we’re no longer guessing what a client might want or need. We’re predicting it, understanding it, and designing entire experiences around it.\n1. Smarter Engagement with AI-Powered Insights\nClient relationships thrive on personalization. The more deeply you understand your client, the better equipped you are to serve them. AI gives us the ability to develop a comprehensive, 360-degree view of each client by analyzing communication patterns, transaction histories, behavior across platforms, and service interactions.\n✅\nReal-time sentiment analysis\nenables teams to detect dissatisfaction or disengagement — even when clients don’t explicitly say something is wrong. Subtle changes in language, tone, or behavior are flagged, helping teams step in before issues escalate.\n✅\nPredictive modeling\nhelps identify clients who may be at risk of churning or those who could benefit from a new service. This allows for timely, personalized outreach that positions your firm as proactive and client focused.\n✅\nAI-optimized communications\nensure the right message is delivered at the right time — increasing engagement, improving response rates, and fostering deeper loyalty.\nAccording to McKinsey’s 2025 State of AI in Consulting report, firms that adopted predictive client engagement strategies saw a 30–50% improvement in client retention and a 25% increase in cross-sell success within the first year.\nThe net effect? You’re not just responding to client needs — you’re anticipating them and delivering value before it’s requested. That’s what transforms service into strategy.\n2. Streamlined Client Onboarding and Communication\nFirst impressions are everything. A clunky or impersonal onboarding process can quickly erode trust. But AI is changing the game here, too.\nAutomated onboarding tools powered by AI can handle initial document collection, frequently asked questions, and scheduling needs — all while maintaining a personalized feel. Natural language processing allows chatbots to interact with clients in human-like ways, offering helpful, context-aware responses that make clients feel attended to.\nMeanwhile, AI-enhanced customer relationship management (CRM) systems intelligently prioritize outreach. For example, a client requesting urgent support can be flagged and elevated automatically, ensuring they’re not buried in a queue. AI can even recommend when to reach out, what to say, and which channel is most likely to get a response.\nBy reducing administrative friction and allowing human agents to focus on higher-value interactions, AI delivers faster, smoother, and more consistent client communication.\nClients don’t want more emails. They want the right message at the right time. AI delivers that.\n3. Delivering Consistency Across All Touchpoints\nOne of the biggest challenges in client relations — especially for firms with distributed teams or multiple communication channels — is maintaining a consistent voice and experience.\nInconsistent service isn’t just confusing for clients; it’s frustrating. One great interaction can be quickly undermined by a disorganized or off-brand follow-up. AI helps address this through intelligent quality control and content standardization.\n✅\nNatural language processing (NLP)\nensures every communication aligns with your brand’s tone, compliance standards, and client expectations. It can scan messages for errors, suggest improvements, and ensure that your team’s communication is polished and on-message.\n✅\nAI-enabled knowledge bases\nmake it easy for team members to access the same source of truth, ensuring accurate and aligned answers across departments.\n✅\nAutomated workflows\nensure that no task falls through the cracks — from proposal delivery to service follow-up, everything is tracked and managed consistently.\nThis level of consistency, at scale, is something only AI can deliver — and it’s critical for building long-term client trust.\n4. Enhancing Trust Through Data Transparency\nToday’s clients are data-savvy and expect transparency. They want to know what’s happening behind the scenes: where their project stands, what’s next, and when to expect results. They don’t want to chase updates — they want to be looped in effortlessly.\nAI-driven dashboards and self-service portals are revolutionizing how clients access information. These tools offer real-time status updates on deliverables, timelines, documents, and even billing — giving clients a sense of control and clarity.\nThis type of transparency fosters deeper trust and reduces the need for manual follow-ups. When clients can see progress for themselves, they’re more confident in your team’s performance — and more likely to recommend your services.\nIn this sense, transparency is more than good service. It’s a trust multiplier.\n5. Tangible Benefits of AI in Client Relations\nLet’s recap the biggest advantages:\n✅ Increased Efficiency\nAI automates repetitive tasks like appointment scheduling, email follow-ups, and data entry, freeing human teams to focus on strategy, empathy, and high-stakes interactions.\n✅ Enhanced Personalization\nBy analyzing data at scale, AI enables teams to craft individualized experiences that resonate. Tailored suggestions, proactive support, and timely engagement deepen client loyalty.\n✅ Cost Savings\nReducing manual work doesn’t just boost efficiency — it cuts costs. From onboarding to support, AI streamlines processes without sacrificing quality.\n✅ Better Decision-Making\nData-driven insights inform better strategies. Whether it’s identifying at-risk clients or tracking satisfaction trends, AI turns raw data into meaningful action.\n✅ Stronger Client Retention\nBy flagging issues early and offering proactive support, AI helps prevent churn and ensures that every client feels seen, valued, and supported.\nThe Strategic Path Forward\nAI is not a plug-and-play solution — it’s a tool that must be strategically deployed. Companies that succeed in using AI for client relations are those that align it with their broader business goals.\nHere are some best practices to ensure success:\n✅ Start with Clear Objectives\nKnow what you want to achieve — whether it’s reducing response time, increasing satisfaction scores, or boosting retention. AI is most effective when it’s directed toward specific, measurable goals.\n✅ Leverage Data Wisely\nAI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Prioritize data integrity and create processes for continuous data enrichment. Invest in systems that capture the full breadth of client interactions.\n✅ Balance Automation and Empathy\nAI can answer questions — but only people can build relationships. Use automation to support your team, not replace them. For complex or emotional issues, always ensure a human is available to step in.\n✅ Monitor, Learn, Adapt\nDon’t set it and forget it. AI strategies must evolve with your clients. Monitor feedback, run A/B tests, and adjust workflows regularly to stay ahead of changing expectations.\n✅ Be Transparent\nLet clients know how AI is used and what data is being collected. Transparency reinforces trust and positions your business as a responsible, client-first organization.\nFinal Thoughts: The Future Is Personal, Predictive, and Proactive\nAI is no longer the future — it’s the present. But it’s also evolving fast. Companies who integrate AI into their client strategy now will lead the market tomorrow.\nThe best client experiences aren’t reactive. They’re consistent, data-informed, and built entirely around the client’s needs. That’s where AI excels. It helps us reimagine how we listen, serve, and connect — and that’s the key to deeper loyalty and long-term value.\nNow is the time to reimagine your client relationships — not with more tools, but with smarter ones.\nLet’s optimize — not just for efficiency, but for experience.\nWritten by Maria Antonio, VP- Client Relations.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

However, not all of fintech is paying off, even as they pay out.\nIn today's corporate world, the ultimate objective is to operate in real time and boost efficiency to the point where execution costs are nil. Every procedure, from the most fundamental to the most complex, is subjected to this endeavour. Payment processing is a good example, particularly in areas where payment processing fees are high and margins are thin.\n“Margins in high-volume retail and groceries are razor-thin. According to John Pistone, senior director of strategy and business development at Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions, “a major retailer may have 1.5 percent margins and pay 1.5 percent interchange fees.” “If they can convert 10% of their credit card users to wallets, they can save millions of dollars every year and treble their client margins.”\nBut, even when they pay off as predicted, not all contemporary financial technologies, generally known as fintech, are paying off.\n“We've had great success with services like Stripe, PayPal, and Square. Sean Pour, co-founder of SellMax, a cash for vehicles business, adds, \"They're all simple to connect and utilise to collect payments.\"\nThe disadvantages, however, are similar to those of earlier financial services, beginning with expensive costs. “Transaction fees are charged by [the services], and they may pile up,” Pour says. “The typical transaction fee is 2.9 percent + 30 cents. Another disadvantage is that they usually keep your money for two days, whereas Stripe might take up to a week to get payment. These services, on the other hand, enable you to take payments rapidly and get up and running.”\nTransformations in the financial sector\nThe payment sector is being transformed by a plethora of present and upcoming fintech, which is making place for disruptors.\n“Fintech allows smaller businesses to compete with big banks and financial institutions. According to Jared Weitz, CEO of United Capital Source, an internet lender for small and medium enterprises, the goal of financial technology services has switched from being the biggest to being the fastest and most effective.\nEven the greatest financial organisations are undergoing adjustments as a result of this transformation.\nAccording to Vikram Gollakota, vice president of strategic alliances at HighRadius, a cloud-based fintech firm, “at a minimum, [fintech] will push financial institutions to re-engineer their systems and value propositions.” Payment transactions can take several days to execute, clear, and settle, he argues, so conventional financial service businesses may benefit from some modernization. Gollakota adds, \"New payment systems strive towards real-time transactions.\" “Real-time payments are a reality, with 39 nations having already adopted them.”\nCompanies that provide financial services are also modifying their service offerings and the sorts of clients they serve. “Fintechs like Revolut, Monzo, Monese, Atom bank, and others are boarding literally millions of people without a credit history and with that level of risk for which banks are not prepared,” says Akim Arhipov, CEO of BASIS ID, a provider of end-user authentication and verification services as well as data privacy compliance services.\nBecause financial services are evolving, it's a good time to differentiate your brand. Payment services, in particular, are an important aspect of the developing customer experience trend.\nStarbucks is a good example of a company that uses payment services as a product feature. Payments are woven into the coffee shop chain's well-known customer care practises. According to Pistone, “Starbucks has more mobile payment users (23.4 million) than Apple, and the loyalty programme accounts for 39 percent of U.S. sales.”\nUsers may order ahead of time, collect loyalty points, apply points, and pay for their orders using the Starbucks mobile app. “Starbucks combines the mobile and in-store experience into what it calls the digital flywheel,” which includes using purchase data to create targeted offers and messaging to customers, according to Pistone. “When offers strike a chord, they become sales. Consumers pay with the least amount of friction, sales are funnelled through loyalty reward programmes, which keep them interested and returning, and the cycle continues.”\nFintech's lineup\nPayment systems use a variety of technologies. Fintech is utilised for a variety of purposes, and as a result, the best technology for one purpose may score low for another. Nonetheless, and in general, here's how typical fintech choices stack up.\nOn the customer side of transactions,\nmobile wallets\nare all about convenience. Mobile wallets are simple to use and sometimes include added features like as budgeting tools.\nThe customer, however, is not the only one who profits. Mobile wallets are proving to be a cost-effective and simple-to-implement solution for businesses.\nAccording to Anastasia Yaskevich, an enterprise mobility researcher at ScienceSoft, a professional software development company, “businesses benefit from mobile payments as well.” \"They eliminate waits and create a quicker customer experience from the purchase intent to approving a transaction\" since mobile payments are quick and straightforward.\n“Bigger businesses build their own applications that include payments and loyalty programmes,” Yaskevich continues, “while other firms encourage the usage of existing mobile wallets, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay.” A point-of-sale terminal with an NFC or QR scanner is all a store requires. Small firms can also use portable NFC scanners that can be readily attached to a smartphone by sales assistants.”\nP2P (peer-to-peer) wallets\nare quickly gaining traction. “Zelle, a\npeer-to-peer (P2P) wallet\nthat competes with PayPal's Venmo for mobile payments, is actually a network of 229 banks lead by Wells Fargo and Bank of America. In 2018, they processed 433 million transactions worth $119 billion in payments,” Pistone notes. “What are the benefits of peer-to-peer? It eliminates the need for cash or credit cards, and it is a huge data collecting tool for customer insights from Zelle and Venmo's perspective.”\nAlthough\ncryptocurrency\nhas a lot of promise, few consumers and companies are willing to pay with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The fact that there is no one blockchain flavour further complicates the situation. Some options are more beneficial than others.\nThere will be a blockchain shakeout at some time, with the best standing remaining. Even so, there are a few more things to think about.\n“The biggest advantage we see with blockchain is that it allows individuals to make immediate payments. Most payment processors may hold your funds for a few days, but if you use bitcoin, you will receive your funds immediately, which can help with cash flow. Furthermore, while bitcoin eliminates many needless bank costs, it does not provide the protection of a federally supported currency,” argues Pour.\nFinancial institutions, on the other hand, recognise the potential rewards. “Blockchain is being used by JPMorgan Chase to improve payment at the time of settlement. “They built the Interbank Information Network, which is a network of 75 banks,” Pistone explains. According to him, the goal is to establish an environment that would allow fintech start-ups to build products for their environment, allowing JPMorgan Chase to collaborate with them rather than fight with them as disruptors.\nCombinations of mobile and blockchain\nare popping up all over the place, most notably on social media networks and messaging applications. Alipay and WeChat Pay, for example, use messaging applications to send money.\nUsing the WhatsApp messaging software, Pistone argues, \"Facebook is now seeking to penetrate this market.\" In India, where WhatsApp has 300 million users, Facebook sees an edge.\n“Facebook is integrating its messaging capabilities with a ‘stable coin,' which is a cryptocurrency tied to a fiat currency such as the US dollar. This is viewed as a method of making retail payments, but it may also be used for remittance. “Combining this payment mechanism with the new Instagram ‘shoppable tags,' according to a Barclays analyst, means Facebook has an extra $19 billion income stream,” Pistone continues.\nPay-at-the-table\n(pay-at-the-table) Restaurants are already embracing fintech. Customers may pay for their orders using tabletop tablets rather than having their credit cards taken away by a waiter. Consider it as a form of self-service payment.\nAccording to Erik Ploof, vice president of business development for TableSafe, a pay-at-the-table solutions provider for the hospitality industry, \"many restaurants around the United States have recently adopted pay-at-the-table technology in an attempt to bring greater operational efficiency, enhanced security, and faster table turns.\" “Some restaurant owners have combined the concepts of table-side ordering and payments into a single system that remains at the table or is controlled by the server.”\nPloof adds that many other operators, particularly full-service operators focusing on exceptional service, see value in separating the payment and ordering processes.\nOther companies, such as bowling alleys, fitness gyms, and hair salons, are considering using fintech. It advantages sectors that want to eliminate centralised payment queues and provider station delays, such as hairdressers who use Square on mobile phones to process payments.\nAccounts payable automation\nincludes everything from paying freelancers to paying supply chain vendors. According to Tom Kieley, CEO of SourceDay, a procure-to-pay and supply chain collaboration software-as-a-service provider, “the added efficiencies that come with enterprise payment tools like accounts payable automation are required to meet today's growing ‘instant gratification' demand, especially for manufacturers and distributors.”\n“Amazon, Walmart, and now Target are all promoting one-day and same-day shipping, almost guaranteeing that this will become the new standard. Merchants will only be able to stay up and compete if they can discover methods to make every link in their supply chain faster—and automating and digitising payment is a key part of that,” Kieley says.\nPersonalized fintech\naims to handle unique payment concerns and satisfy individual requirements. “What motivates a person to take a metal prepaid card and deposit money on it? Fintechs provide their consumers a sense of significance, success, and revolutionism by providing these cards, adds Arhipov. “Or choose Zestful, which is a debit card for your staff. They are given a budget for an employee benefit programme, which they may use for training or fitness. Accountants will no longer be reimbursed. Isn't it good for the soul?”\nThe new layaway programmes are\npoint-of-sale\n(POS) loans. They're especially popular among millennials, who despise debt and shun using credit cards.\nThe benefits of POS loans to consumers begin with the fact that they are interest-free. “Lending businesses, like credit card companies, impose a fee to the store on the transaction,” Pistone continues. “Usually, POS loans are paid in instalments, such as four monthly payments of X dollars. However, you can take the purchased item home today. In the past, you would purchase a refrigerator [on layaway] and only take it home after completing the final payment. Approvals are given right away.”\nThe bottom line in effective fintech is total value. “It's not really about technology; it's about personalising the experience, people's behaviour, and brand,” Arhipov adds. “Whether personal or corporate, fintechs must develop a strong brand, and it is all about value rather than volume.”\nLeaders may learn a lot from payment systems.\nProvide clients with a variety of payment alternatives. Making it simple for clients to pay improves their experience and motivates them to buy again.\nTo reduce financial service prices, consider giving extra perks and discounts. Provide clients with a discount or other benefits if they use certain payment methods.\nNegotiate better terms with conventional banks using modern technology. To save money and enhance cash flow, consider renegotiating bank fees, conditions, and services with your traditional banks, such as real-time deposit and payment crediting.\nCustomize payment alternatives for your brand and link them to loyalty programmes. Consider creating your own applications that incorporate payment methods and loyalty programmes, similar to what Starbucks has done.\n#PaymentSystems #AccountsPayable #Personalizedfintech #Cryptocurrency\nArticle Credits –\nhpe.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nEverything you need to know about Payment Protection Program\nWhile we all intend to pay our bills on time, life occasionally throws us a curveball that prevents us from doing so.

They are an important aspect of retirement planning, as they can impact your taxable income and limit the growth of your retirement savings. By understanding RMDs, you can avoid penalties and make the most of your retirement savings.\nWhat are RMDs?\nRMDs are a requirement for withdrawing a portion of your retirement savings each year and paying taxes on those withdrawals. They are mandatory withdrawals from certain types of retirement accounts and are calculated based on your age and the balance of your retirement account.\nWhen Do You Need to Take RMDs?\nYou must start taking RMDs by April 1st of the year following the year you turn 72 (or 70 ½ if you turned 70 ½ before January 1, 2020). After that, you must take an RMD by December 31st of each subsequent year. Failing to take your RMD can result in penalties and additional taxes.\nHow Are RMDs Calculated??\nRMDs are calculated based on your age and the balance of your retirement account. The formula to calculate your RMD is:\nRMD = Account Balance ÷ Distribution Period\nThe distribution period is determined by the IRS life expectancy tables.\nHow Do RMDs Affect Your Retirement Planning?\nRMDs can increase your taxable income and potentially push you into a higher tax bracket, which can reduce the amount of money you have available for expenses and limit the growth of your retirement savings. However, there are strategies you can use to minimize the impact of RMDs on your retirement planning, such as considering tax-efficient withdrawal strategies and evaluating the timing of Roth conversions.\nReal-Life Scenario #1\nLet’s say you have a traditional IRA with a balance of $500,000 and you turn 72 in 2023. According to the IRS life expectancy tables, your distribution period is 25.6 years. Your first RMD would be calculated as:\nRMD = $500,000 ÷ 25.6 = $19,531.25\nYou would need to withdraw at least $19,531.25 from your IRA by April 1st of 2024.\nReal-Life Scenario #2\nNow let’s say you have multiple retirement accounts, including a traditional IRA, a 401(k), and a Roth IRA. When it comes to RMDs, you need to calculate and take them separately for each account. However, you can take your total RMD amount from any of your accounts as long as the total amount meets the minimum required. For example, if your total RMD amount for the year is $50,000, you could take $20,000 from your traditional IRA, $20,000 from your 401(k), and $10,000 from your Roth IRA.\nConclusion\nRMDs can be complex, but understanding what they are and how they work is essential for effective retirement planning. By staying informed and taking proactive steps to manage your RMDs, you can make the most of your retirement savings and avoid penalties.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\nIRS.gov: Retirement Topics – Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) (\nhttps://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-required-minimum-distributions-rmds\n)\nInvestopedia: Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) (\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rmd.asp\n)\nThe Balance: How to Calculate Your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) (\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/how-to-calculate-your-required-minimum-distribution-rmd-2388257\n)\nFAQs\nWhat happens if I don't take my RMD?\nIf you don’t take your RMD or withdraw less than the required amount, you may be subject to a penalty of 50% of the amount not taken.\nWhat are the new contribution limits for 401k plans in 2023?\nNo, RMDs are not required for Roth IRAs. However, RMDs are required for traditional IRAs and Roth 401(k)s.\nCan I withdraw more than the RMD amount?\nYes, you can withdraw more than the RMD amount, but keep in mind that the additional amount will be subject to taxes.\nCan I roll over my RMD to another retirement account?\nNo, you cannot roll over your RMD to another retirement account. However, you can use the distribution to contribute to another retirement account if you meet certain eligibility requirements.\nWhat to Know About RMDs and Retirement Planning\nRetirement planning can be complicated, but understanding Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) is essential for making informed decisions about your retirement savings. In this blog post, we’ll explain what RMDs are, when you need to take them, how they’re calculated, and how they can impact your retirement planning.\nRelated Topic Blog\nHow Occams Can Provide a Fresh Perspective to your business\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Real Life Case Studies FAQ's Conclusion Citations/SourcesIntroduction Occam's Advisory is a business consulting firm that provides a fresh perspectiv...\nRead More\nIs there a tax deduction for corporate insurance?\nThe cost of business insurance is normally deductible from gross profits for small business owners.

Apart from that, there are a number of distinctions that make selling a service industry more complex and challenging.\nFor one thing, unlike goods, resources cannot be mass-produced, and consumer feedback is far more prominent. In contrast to goods that can be designed to be foolproof, an uncooperative consumer can greatly impair service efficiency. Nonetheless, in every service sector, marketing is a critical component of profitability, and you must get it right. Here are a few pointers to help you do exactly that:\n1. Differentiation in the early stages of consciousness\nUnlike goods, where articles will be written and even minor distinctions will be noted in order to rate one product above another, most service companies offer identical services. So, in order to get into a market, you'll need to focus your specific selling proposition on one region.\nIt may be cheaper prices, a shorter processing time, or a specialty, but there has to be something that can convince people to choose the service over the more developed ones. You can make them see other ways your service is better when they recruit you, but the initial distinction is crucial to attracting new clients.\n“When attempting to build your position through pricing, it's crucial to be conservative in your approach,” says Rene Langer, CEO of PICKHVAC, which created an online tool to link contractors and clients. If you're too competitive, you'll be limited to the low-end of the market with razor-thin profits, while if you're not aggressive enough, you won't be able to attract enough customers to give the company the critical mass it requires. It's preferable to concentrate on worth rather than costs. Use deals and packages to persuade consumers that with you, they'll get more bang for their buck.\"\n2. To receive references, have excellent customer support.\nCustomer experience is now one of the most critical factors to remember for any service-oriented business. It's also a key factor in how willing your clients are to recommend you to their friends and families, so doing it right should be a priority in your marketing campaigns.\nThe first step is to thoroughly educate your employees so that they appreciate the importance of excellent customer support and how to deliver it. Many consumers would not care to complain, but poor customer service from all of your employees will make them want to avoid doing business with you in the future. Aside from teaching, excellent customer service is critical, even after a service has been completed.\nIt's vital not to go crazy, though; you don't want to be known as the guy who sends spammy emails all the time and is finally blocked. Instead, send out useful reports about the service on a regular basis. That way, you'll keep your company front of mind while still ensuring a good reputation for the next time a former customer requires your services.\n3. Marketing nimbleness\nYour rivals aren't going to hang around waiting for you to step in and steal care of their company. It's possible that they'll change things up over time as well, particularly because service businesses' labels are more adaptable than product brands.\nAnd, if you use versatility properly, it will work in your favour. Keep an eye on your\ncontent analytics\nto see what's progressing and what needs to be tweaked, and make sure your social media reporting is in good shape so you can react rapidly and accurately if anything happens on social media. Strong or negative reviews may be transformed into favourable marketing for the brand if done correctly.\nOverall, selling a service company is difficult. However, if done correctly, you will enter a market, stake your claim, and gradually increase your market share.\n#ServiceBusiness #Marketing #Customers #NimbleMarketing\nArticle Credits –\nentrepreneur.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nFrom Panic to Poise: Unraveling the Mystery of the IRS Audit...\nThe dreaded IRS audits.

In this blog post, we’ll explore why climate change action is important for companies and businesses, and provide practical steps that they can take to address it.\nIntroduction\nAs the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, businesses are under pressure to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Taking action on climate change is not only a moral imperative but also makes good business sense.\nWhy Climate Change Action is Important for Companies\nClimate change presents significant risks and opportunities for companies. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea level rise can disrupt supply chains, increase energy costs, and damage infrastructure. At the same time, taking action on climate change can help companies reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enhance their brand reputation.\nSteps Companies Can Take to Address Climate Change\nCompanies can take a variety of steps to address climate change, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable business practices. Some practical steps that companies can take include:\nConducting a greenhouse gas inventory to identify emissions sources and set reduction targets\nInvesting in renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power\nReducing energy consumption through energy efficiency measures\nImplementing sustainable transportation practices, such as telecommuting or carpooling\nReducing waste and increasing recycling and composting\nEngaging with suppliers to encourage sustainable practices throughout the supply chain\nReal-Life Scenario #1\nLet’s say a manufacturing company decides to invest in solar power to reduce their energy costs and lower their greenhouse gas emissions. They install solar panels on the roof of their facility, which generates enough electricity to power their operations during the day. As a result, they are able to reduce their energy bills and their greenhouse gas emissions, while also enhancing their reputation as a sustainable business.\nReal-Life Scenario #2\nNow let’s say a transportation company decides to implement a telecommuting program for their employees. By allowing employees to work from home, the company is able to reduce their carbon footprint and lower their energy costs. Additionally, employees benefit from reduced commute times and increased flexibility, which can improve morale and productivity.\nBenefits of Climate Change Action for Companies\nTaking action on climate change can provide a range of benefits for companies, including:\nCost savings from reduced energy and resource consumption\nImproved brand reputation and customer loyalty\nEnhanced competitiveness in a changing business landscape\nReduced regulatory and legal risks\nImproved employee morale\nConclusion\nClimate change is a pressing issue that requires action from all sectors of society. Companies and businesses have an important role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability. By taking practical steps to address climate change, companies can not only reduce their environmental impact but also enhance their business performance and reputation.\nFAQs\nWhat are the benefits of transitioning to renewable energy sources?\nTransitioning to renewable energy sources can help companies reduce their carbon footprint, lower their energy costs, and enhance their brand reputation.\nHow can companies reduce waste and increase recycling and composting?\nCompanies can reduce waste by implementing waste reduction measures, such as reducing packaging, and increasing recycling and composting through education and awareness campaigns.\nHow can companies engage with suppliers to encourage sustainable practices?\nCompanies can engage with suppliers by setting sustainability criteria for their purchasing decisions, conducting supplier audits, and collaborating with suppliers to develop sustainability initiatives.\nWhat are the legal risks associated with climate change?\nCompanies may face legal risks related to climate change, such as lawsuits related to environmental damage or failure to comply with emissions regulations. It’s important to stay informed about relevant laws and regulations and work with legal counsel to mitigate these risks.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\nUnited Nations: Climate Action for Business (\nhttps://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-action-business.shtml\n)\nHarvard Business Review: Why Every Business Should Include Climate Change in Its Strategy (\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/12/why-every-business-needs-a-climate-strategy\n)\nForbes: Why Companies Are Taking Action On Climate Change (\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2021/01/26/why-companies-are-taking-action-on-climate-change/?sh=7c77e4520a89\n)\nRelated Topic Blog\nRaising capital: Each investor needs to know three things\nYou want a lot of information on how the investment can be spent when you are an investor being approached to provide a growing corporation with millions of dollars in cash.

It started with a feeling, a few bold questions, and a bunch of people who were willing to try something new, even if they didn’t have all the answers.\nIt really took off when a few of us at Occams Advisory, across brand, tech, and strategy, noticed something. Our clients didn’t just want advice. They wanted someone to roll up their sleeves and get things done. To move fast, build smart, and think ahead.\nWe could’ve said, “What if this is too much?” But instead, someone said,\n“Even if it’s hard, we’ve got the people to do it.”\nThat mindset, to move through uncertainty, not wait for it to disappear, is what built Occams Digital. It didn’t come from overthinking. It came from energy, from belief, from just going for it.\nFear vs. Courage: The “What If” vs. “Even If” Battle\nFear sounds like “what if”\nSuccess sounds like “even if”\nLet’s be real for a second.\nYou’re mid-pitch, your inbox is wild, your coffee’s gone cold, and suddenly, your brain whispers:\n“What if I screw this up?”\n“What if this flops harder than my high school dance moves?”\n“What if I’m not ready?”\nThat’s fear of talking. And fear loves “what if.” It feeds off doubt and loves to keep you stuck.\nBut if you listen closely, there’s another voice. Softer, but stronger.\nIt says:\n“Even if I mess up, I’ll learn.”\n“Even if it’s tough, I’ll figure it out.”\n“Even if I’m nervous, I’ll show up anyway.”\nThat’s courage. That’s how momentum starts.\nTiny words, big shift\nHere’s the truth:\n“What if” is like a weather app that only predicts storms.\n“Even if” is like your best friend saying, “Yeah, it might rain, but we’ve got umbrellas.”\nAs our CXO\nMukarram\nsays,\n“Fear is natural. It keeps us safe. But everything worth doing happens when we push through it.”\nSo sure, fear can come along for the ride. Just don’t give it the steering wheel.\nThe Occams Digital leap\nWhen we started Occams Digital, the “what ifs” were loud.\n“What if the timing’s off?”\n“What if this doesn’t land?”\n“What if we don’t even have our systems in place yet?”\nThat’s when\nHarsh Golani\n, who leads Brand Communication, said something that stuck:\n“What if this doesn’t go as planned? Even if it doesn’t, we’ve got the kind of team that knows how to pivot, rebuild, and keep moving.”\nZidane Zafar\n, our Creative Director, said it like a poet:\n“Fear asked, ‘What if it doesn’t work?’ Success replied, ‘Even if it’s hard, it’s worth it.”\nWe almost printed that on a hoodie.\nAnd then there’s\nBipin Singh\n, who runs digital marketing. He kept it simple:\n“The market was crowded. It felt like showing up late to a packed party. But we knew that even if the room was full, what we had to say was fresh. And people noticed.”\nAnd they really did.\nThese weren’t just cool quotes. They were fuel. That’s the mindset we live by.\nThis week, try this: Flip your script\nThis week, try this: Flip your script\nThink of one thing you’ve been stuck on.\nA project, a decision, maybe even something personal.\nNow write it out. First with “what if.”\nThen flip it to “even if.”\nSay it out loud. Share it with someone who gets it.\nNotice what changes.\nFinal thought\nFear will always show up. That’s fine.\nJust don’t let it lead.\nThe magic happens when we move anyway, even if.\nOccams Digital wasn’t built in perfect conditions. It was built in motion. With belief. With people who said,\n“Even if it’s hard, it’s worth it.”\nAnd we’re just getting started, the Occams way.\n– Team Occams\nExplore Occams Digital here:\ndigital.occamsadvisory.com\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

In both the internal organisation and the external work market, wage systems are composed of pay rates that represent the importance of a position.\nCompensation systems tend to improve the study of fair pay and market demand, making it possible to compare pay across categories of workers. HR professionals should adapt their salary arrangements as the competition shifts to ensure that personnel are paid equitably relative to their rivals within the same wage system.\nThere are various types of systems for payments. Knowing how each structure of compensation works and where it is reasonable to use each will help you control salaries and ensure that workers are paying equally over time.\nStructures with Grade Range Compensation (a.k.a. Typical Structures)\nCompensation schemes for the grade spectrum help to fit positions that are considered equal in terms of duties and rank into separate grades of pay. They will be transferred from one pay scale to the next if an employee is advanced. When workers learn new skills and undertake new positions with increased duties, they may have chances to transfer along the way to superseding wage scales, increasing pay (and pay potential).\nAs grade-range pay structures increase, wage scales grow broader to match higher earnings that come with employment at the upper end. It is easier to manage and engage in a conventional wage system when you can imagine how a vast range of grades display varying degrees of transparency.\nStructures of Grade Range reimbursement are strongest when:\nYour business is broad, well-defined, and has extended hierarchies of management.\nFor all stages of the company, wage advancement happens within classes.\nYou want the opportunity to have more regular level shifts and promotions early in the career of an employee.\nCompensation mechanisms for broadband\nThe several grades contained in a conventional wage hierarchy are consolidated into a few larger salary bands through\nbroadband pay systems\n. The wage scales are larger in broadband pay systems than in grade-range compensation structures. Broadband wage systems appear to bring more focus on career advancement rather than work progression, since workers remain for much longer within a single band.\nThe grade level is wider to accommodate wages for new workers within it, since broadband salary systems have a greater minimum to maximum wage spectrum distribution. In other words, there is a noticeably lower cumulative number of grades in the system. Every band indicates a broader variety of salaries, better advancement in the midpoint between each grade of income, and less variation between grades when it comes to different occupations with identical pay.\nCompensation mechanisms for broadband are strongest when:\nJob appraisal alone doesn't drive grade choices.\nYou ought to concentrate on praising individuals for skill learning.\nFor compensation determination and administration, you need greater consistency.\nCompensation Mechanisms for Work Range\nBy mapping the pay levels for workers at their market cost, work range systems placed each individual job into their own special wage classes.\nYou have to be sure that you are matching and pricing the workers of the company correctly when designing this form of pay structure. When there are enough workers within a position for it to have its own selection, this arrangement is ideally suited. For starters, you can be able to position them in their own set of positions if you have a whole squad of business development reps.\nStructures for work range rewards are best when:\nDue to enhanced business conditions, you have several hot workers which consumer values change rapidly.\nYou strongly stress competition in the market.\nYou should compare and market jobs in your company correctly.\nStructures of Stage Payments\nDepending on a pre-set calendar, as pay rates go up periodically, it is called stepping. In industries where rewarding success is less applicable than tenure, stage systems are usually focused on tenure and work better. An employee with 5 years of experience, for instance, will deliver more than an employee with 4 years of experience.\nStage systems are easy to administer and simplify because they are entirely dependent on employee tenure and their salary rises. Both workers earn pay raises at a set rate as a part of these incentive systems. A phase structure is a smart choice if your company has a smaller salary budget, or you choose not to focus your compensation philosophy solely on individual success. Civil service positions also use a stage structure, such as first responders.\nCompensation mechanisms based on steps are strongest when:\nYou want the costs for your work to be predictable.\nProgression based on results is not a priority for your reward.\nYour wage rises around the business are gradual and constant.\nStructures of Market-based rewards\nCompensation systems focused on the competition are centred purely on what the market pays for equivalent work. Within-grade, larger organisations that have these pay systems appear to have broader wage ranges, while smaller companies have smaller wage ranges. Data outlets such as wage assessments impact the wages for market-based systems, maintaining reliable work pricing across each grade.\nStructures of reimbursement based on the market are best when:\nFor salary statistics, you prefer depending on the market.\nYou should not have a theory of performance-based compensation.\nYou have a well-defined organisation, but with salary determinations, you want to be agile.\nArticle Credits –\nsalary.com\n#CompensationStructures #BroadbandCompensation #StepStructures #MarketBasedCompensation\nRelated Topic Blog\nMotion Graphics in B2B: Breathing Life into Professional Ser...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction What Are Motion Graphics, really?

From analysing customer behaviour to automating complex tasks, AI empowers product managers to make data-driven decisions and focus on innovation. By embedding AI into the\n4 P’s of Product Management—\nProduct, Price, Place, and Promotion—companies can improve efficiency, elevate user experiences, and achieve greater profitability.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore how AI integrates with these four pillars of product management and discuss real-world applications to illustrate its transformative potential.\nProduct: AI-Enhanced Development and Innovation\nThe success of a product begins with how well it addresses customer needs. AI accelerates this process by enabling better ideation, design, and iteration.\nSmarter Ideation:\nAI tools, like OpenAI’s GPT models, analyse market trends and customer feedback to prioritize features that matter most. This eliminates guesswork and ensures a product’s relevance in competitive markets.Example: A fitness app uses AI to analyse user feedback, discovering the demand for a personalized meal planning feature, which becomes a key differentiator.\nStreamlined Design:\nPlatforms such as Adobe XD and Figma now integrate AI to automate repetitive tasks like resizing elements or suggesting colour schemes. These tools save hours for design teams and ensure consistency across products.\nPredictive Product Performance:\nAI-powered analytics help predict how a new feature or product will perform based on historical data. This allows managers to refine designs before launch, saving time and resources.Real-World Insight: By leveraging AI in product development, Tesla optimizes its software updates based on user data, enhancing the driving experience.\nTakeaway:\nAI makes product development faster, more user-centric, and adaptive to market demands.\nPrice: Optimized Pricing Strategies with AI\nPlace: Smarter Distribution Channels\nWhere and how a product is made available can significantly impact its success. AI improves supply chain management and distribution strategies to meet demand efficiently.\nDemand Forecasting:\nBy analysing historical sales data, social trends, and external factors like weather, AI predicts demand accurately. This helps businesses avoid overstocking or understocking.\nExample: A retail chain uses AI to stock sunscreen in higher quantities in coastal areas during summer months.\nChannel Optimization:\nAI evaluates the performance of various distribution channels, such as online platforms, physical stores, or third-party resellers. Businesses can focus on the most profitable channels.\nLogistics Automation:\nAI-powered logistics systems optimize delivery routes, reducing costs and ensuring timely delivery.\nReal-World Insight: Walmart employs AI to manage inventory and streamline supply chains, leading to reduced wastage and operational efficiency.\nTakeaway:\nAI enables businesses to get the right product to the right place at the right time, enhancing customer satisfaction.\nPromotion: Personalizing Marketing Campaigns\nPromotion is where businesses interact directly with customers, and AI makes this interaction more impactful through personalization and real-time optimization.\nTargeted Advertising:\nAI identifies and segments high-value audiences, ensuring that marketing campaigns reach the right people.\nFor example, Google Ads uses AI to optimize ad placements and bidding strategies.\nContent Creation:\nTools like Jasper or Writesonic assist in creating compelling, tailored content for blogs, emails, and advertisements. These tools save time while maintaining quality.Example: A skincare brand uses AI to generate personalized email campaigns, promoting products based on individual skin types and preferences.\nReal-Time Campaign Optimization:\nAI monitors campaign performance and suggests adjustments, such as reallocating budget to better-performing ads or tweaking messaging for higher engagement.\nReal-World Insight: Spotify uses AI to recommend personalized playlists and promote its premium subscription, driving higher engagement and conversion rates.\nTakeaway:\nAI-powered promotion ensures that every marketing dollar is spent effectively, leading to higher ROI.\nAI-Driven Product Management Framework\nBelow is a graphical representation of how AI integrates with the 4 P’s of Product Management:\nFlowchart Highlights:\nProduct (AI)\ndrives innovation and feature development.\nPrice (AI)\nensures optimized, data-driven pricing.\nPlace (AI)\nstreamlines distribution and logistics.\nPromotion (AI)\ndelivers personalized and effective marketing.\nConclusion: Embracing the Future of Product Management with AI\nAI is revolutionizing product management by enhancing efficiency and enabling smarter decisions across the 4 P’s—Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. These innovations empower product managers to stay ahead of the curve, delivering exceptional value to customers and stakeholders alike.\nAs AI continues to evolve, its integration into product management will become more seamless and impactful. For businesses yet to embrace AI, now is the time to explore tools that can transform your product lifecycle and drive sustainable growth.\nNext Steps:\nStart small. Incorporate AI into one aspect of the 4 P’s and scale as you observe its impact. The future of product management is here—be ready to lead it.\nWritten by Sunny Shekhar, Lead- Product Development, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

They represent over 90 percent of all businesses, significantly contribute to value-added activities, and employ a substantial portion of the workforce. MSMEs drive innovation, foster competition, and enhance economic dynamism. Despite their importance, MSMEs often struggle with productivity compared to larger companies and face numerous structural barriers, including high compliance costs and limited access to finance. This white paper, inspired by the McKinsey report “A Microscope on Small Businesses,” explores the potential for MSMEs to thrive by leveraging internal resources and minimizing dependence on external financing.\nThe Importance of MSMEs\nMSMEs are foundational to both advanced and emerging economies:\nEconomic Contribution:\nThey account for half of global GDP.\nEmployment:\nIn emerging economies, MSMEs employ four-fifths of all workers compared to two-thirds in advanced economies.\nInnovation and Competition:\nMSMEs promote continuous improvement in products, services, and processes, enhancing overall economic productivity and dynamism.\nGrowth Potential:\nMany large companies today started as MSMEs.\nChallenges Faced by MSMEs\nDespite their potential, MSMEs face significant challenges:\nProductivity Gap:\nMSMEs typically have lower productivity compared to larger companies.\nStructural Barriers:\nHigh compliance costs and limited access to finance constrain growth..\nMarket Access:\nMSMEs often struggle to access global markets and benefit from global procurement.\nKey Findings from the McKinsey Report\nThe McKinsey report highlights several critical insights:\nProfit-Funded Growth:\nMSMEs that rely on internal profits rather than external financing are more likely to scale up.\nImpact on Economies:\nRaising MSMEs to top-quartile productivity levels can significantly boost GDP—by 5 percent in advanced economies and 10 percent in emerging economies.\nGlobal Networks:\nBuilding a global support network for MSMEs can help them leverage resources across verticals, mirroring the scale of larger enterprises without additional infrastructure and cost.\nStrategies for Maximizing Internal Resources\n1. Focus on Cash Flow Management\nEfficient cash flow management ensures that businesses can meet their obligations without relying on external financing. Strategies include:\nEfficient Invoicing:\nStreamline invoicing and collection processes to speed up cash inflows.\nExpense Monitoring:\nRegularly review expenses and identify cost-saving opportunities.\n2.

This resulted in a significant loss of taxpayer funds.\nCauses\nOpen-ended eligibility criteria:\nThe generous credit amount (up to $26,000 per employee) and initially unclear eligibility rules created an opportunity for abuse.\nRise of “ERC mills”:\nPop-up firms and marketers aggressively promoted credit, leading to a surge of questionable claims even after the pandemic subsided.\nImpact\nOver $225 million in returned credits:\nOver 1,000 employees voluntarily returned credits through the IRS disclosure program.\nMillions more recovered through audits:\nThe IRS identified and assessed over $572 million in improper claims through audits.\n$1 billion+ in potential losses:\nThis includes returned funds, assessed claims, and the estimated impact of a congressional bill aiming to stop illegitimate claims.\nProcessing delays:\nThe IRS is meticulously reviewing the remaining 1.2 million claims, leading to processing delays for legitimate businesses.\nResponses\nIRS initiatives:\nVoluntary disclosure program with incentives for ineligible recipients to return funds.\nIncreased audits and enforcement actions.\nMoratorium on processing new claims (until late spring 2024).\nCriminal investigations into suspicious claims (~$3 billion worth).\nProposed legislation:\nA bipartisan bill aims to cut off ERC claims filed after January 2024, potentially saving $78 billion.\nThe bill also proposes harsher penalties for ERC scheme promoters and extended audit windows for the IRS.\nConsidering a Second Look:\nSome businesses who used third-party advisors to claim the ERC may now be concerned about the validity of their claims, especially in light of the increased scrutiny.\nSolution\nOccams ERC Audit Advisory: Peace of Mind Through Expertise\nFor businesses seeking clarity on their ERC claims, Occams Advisory offers a comprehensive ERC Audit Advisory service. Their team of tax specialists can help you:\nReview your ERC eligibility:\nDetermine if your business truly qualified for the credit based on the latest IRS guidelines.\nAssess potential risks:\nIdentify areas of concern within your original claim to minimize the chance of IRS penalties.\nDevelop a strategic response:\nIf necessary, they can guide you through the IRS voluntary disclosure program or prepare for a potential audit.\nDon’t navigate this alone. Contact Occams Advisory today to schedule a free consultation and ensure peace of mind regarding your ERC claim.\nCurrent Status:\nThe IRS is still processing a backlog of claims and the moratorium on new claims remains in effect.\nThe fate of the proposed legislation in the Senate is uncertain.\nConclusion\nThe ERC program highlights the challenges of balancing economic stimulus with proper oversight. The IRS’s efforts to combat fraud and the potential legislative changes indicate a commitment to recouping misused funds. However, the long-term impact on legitimate businesses due to processing delays and stricter regulations remains to be seen. Businesses with concerns about their ERC claims are advised to seek professional guidance.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation :\nClick here\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this case study is intended for general informational purposes only and are gathered from multiple news publications.

Unlike rigorous analytical tools and frameworks,\n“Think, Feel, Act”\noffers a simple, intuitive approach to business strategy that owners can use to guide employees through organizational change and as a marketing tool to better understand and influence client behavior. This white paper provides a comprehensive guide on how business owners can implement the\n“Think, Feel, Act”\nframework as an effective tool for creating a cohesive team of brand ambassadors for the company and influencing client behavior, drawing from Occams Advisory’s successful application of this framework in achieving these outcomes.\n“Think, Feel, Act” in Managing Organizational Change\nChange is the only constant in life, and the business world is no exception to that. This is especially true for small businesses, who have to grow their concepts to be viable and scalable. In times of organizational change, it’s essential for business owners to effectively communicate to their team to maintain cohesion. Here’s where the\n“Think, Feel, Act”\nmodel can come into play to make these transition periods easier for everyone.\nThink: Get employees on the same page\nImplementing an organizational change–shift in the business model, rebranding, or cultural change–can be difficult for employees to adjust to, especially when operations are already smooth. Clear communication from business leadership— explaining the reason behind changes, expected outcomes, and impact on the organization and individual roles—is essential for employees to get on the same page as the leadership. When Occams Advisory implements a change, such as expanding its service offerings, leadership holds town halls and Q&A sessions to clarify the purpose and impact on each team. Departments receive tailored guidance on role adjustments, and training is provided to prepare employees for new responsibilities. Change champions within teams support peers, and regular check-ins ensure ongoing feedback, making the transition collaborative and aligned with Occams’ vision.\nFeel: Tend to emotions\nWhen initially proposing change, you might get a few raised eyebrows, pursed lips, and voices of concern by unsettled employees. Business owners must lend emotional support to their employees by addressing insecurities and inspiring confidence, helping their team embrace change rather than avoid it. Employees who feel valued as key contributors to the company’s success will demonstrate better resilience and adaptability during organizational change. At Occams Advisory, supporting employees through change is essential. During any internal shift—like expanding services or restructuring—leadership holds open discussions to address concerns, reinforcing each team member’s role and value. Regular meetings and peer support networks foster transparency and trust, ensuring that everyone feels heard and appreciated. This approach builds morale, resilience, and a unified, adaptable team ready to embrace new challenges together.\nAct: Turn enthusiasm into action\nOnce employees are familiarized and invested in your vision for change, they need clear calls to action. What exactly do employees have to do to fulfill your organizational vision? Suggest specific actions that are relevant and achievable. Occams Advisory example\n(Photo Illustration Concept By NAIOP)\nhttps://www.naiopmd.org/news/what-to-know-about-the-corporate-transparency-act/\nA Team of Brand Ambassadors\nA powerful outcome of applying the\n“Think, Feel, Act”\nmodel is that employees naturally evolve into brand ambassadors, actively championing the company’s values and goals. This way, owners do not have to feel trapped in an “isolation chamber” where they are running the business all alone. Employees that think, feel, and act with an owner’s mindset can apply the above steps as well, making transition periods during organizational change even smoother and successful. Occams Advisory started exploring the idea very organically to build its brand positioning and ideology. In a world full off grey, Occams decided to use its own employees as their ambassadors. Who better to tell their story than the employees who work within the organisation.\n“Think, Feel, Act” in Client Strategy\nAccording to research conducted by Forrester Consulting, how a customer thinks and feels are statistically significant drivers of business outcomes like purchase, loyalty, and advocacy. To influence and increase these outcomes, companies must understand the following client behavior:\nThink: Clients’ Cognitive Process\nOnce clients recognize a need for a product or service, they will weigh different options in the market, assessing which product or service best addresses their pain points.\nFeel: Clients’ Emotional Aspect\nCustomers develop feelings and emotions based on their interactions with the brand and how it resonates with their values and aspirations.\nAct: Clients’ Conversion to Purchase\nAfter careful consideration, clients eventually make the decision to purchase the product/service or engage with the brand.\nConclusion\nAlthough having important applications in corporate settings, the\n“Think, Feel, Act”\nframework is not exclusive to the workplace. At its core, it’s a universal approach to understanding the human mind – helping us recognize why we and others think, feel, and act the way we do, and taking that awareness to facilitate better decision-making in both professional and personal contexts. The increased mindfulness that comes with adopting this framework promotes healthier workplaces, relationships, and mental well-being. Business strategy is often overcrowded with complex jargon and elaborate models that not every business owner can resonate with, so it’s refreshing to see how a framework as simple and intuitive as\n“Think, Feel, Act”\ncan have a profound effect on not just workplace efficiency and performance, but in life.\nSources/Citations\n1.

Two primary options stand out: equity financing and debt financing. Each comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, making the choice a delicate one.\nReal Life Scenarios:\nLet’s consider two contrasting scenarios:\nStart-up A: This young, tech-driven company has a revolutionary product with high growth potential. However, it has limited cash flow and needs capital to scale. Equity financing seems ideal, allowing it to attract investors who believe in its vision while avoiding the burden of fixed debt payments.\nCompany B: This established, brick-and-mortar business has a steady cash flow and needs capital for expansion. Debt financing appears advantageous, as it allows them to maintain control and leverage tax benefits without diluting ownership.\nFAQs\nWhat are the key differences between equity and debt financing?\nOwnership: Equity holders own a part of the company, while debt holders are creditors.\nRepayment: Equity investors expect a return on their investment, which can be realized through dividends or capital appreciation. Debt holders receive fixed interest payments and the repayment of principal at maturity.\nControl: Equity holders may have voting rights and influence on the company’s decision-making, while debt holders typically have no such rights.\nWhich option is better for my company?\nIt depends. Consider your company’s stage of growth, risk tolerance, credit rating, and growth potential. Consult financial advisors for tailored advice.\nWhat role can Occams Advisory play?\nOccams Advisory can assist with:\nFinancial modeling and forecasting: Assess the impact of different financing options.\nInvestment banking services: Connect with potential investors and negotiate terms.\nMerger and acquisition advisory\n: Explore alternative capital raising strategies.\nConclusions\nBoth equity and debt financing have their merits and drawbacks. By understanding the key differences and carefully considering your company’s specific circumstances, you can make an informed decision that fuels your growth trajectory.\nSources and Citations\nDebt Dilution and Seniority in a Model of Defaultable Sovereign Debt – Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nhttps://www.iae.csic.es/investigatorsMaterial/a1812155634sp19311.pdf\nDisclaimer\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

The tariffs, which take effect between April 5th and 9th, have rattled global markets, sparked fears of a trade war, and marked the most significant tax hike since 1942. A combination of declines in the S&P PMI, consumer confidence, ISM PMI, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—alongside rising Core PCE prices and Michigan inflation expectations—signals a shift toward a stagflationary economy marked by high inflation and low output. In Trump’s view, the tariffs will re-shore manufacturing, eliminate massive trade deficits, and usher in a new global order where America is no longer “ripped off” by foreign nations. However, the immediate fallout—surging prices, renewed protectionism, and plummeting markets cast uncertainty over Trump’s long-term vision of a reindustrialized, booming America coming to fruition. This whitepaper will break down the economic impact of the tariff policy, assess the “MAGA masterplan” of a new global order conducive to American interests, and guide SME owners on how they can weather these uncertain times with Occams Advisory’s expertise.\nTariffs Send Wall Street Reeling\nTrump’s sweeping tariffs rattled global markets as over $6.6 trillion in stock market value was wiped off Wall Street, all three major stock indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq) tumbled over 5%, Nasdaq and Russel 2000 entered bear markets, commodities like oil and copper plunged, and the US dollar sank. This marks the worst week for the US stocks since the COVID-19 crash. Analysts at major banks like JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs warn of a looming recession. In a report headlined “There will be blood,” JP Morgan warns, “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and possibly global economy into recession this year. An update of our probability scenario tree makes this point, raising the risk of a recession this year to 60%.” The Federal Reserve, under Powell’s assessment that “significantly larger than expected” tariffs will cause “higher inflation and slower growth,” will not see fit to lower interest rates and move further from the 2% inflation target, despite President Trump’s demands for Powell to “CUT INTEREST RATES AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” on a recent Truth social. Rob Citrone, founder of Discovery Capital Management, captured the current chaos in a client’s note, stating, “This environment is one of those times when my investment roadmap feels less like a drive down I-95 and more like navigating NYC rush hour with Waze constantly rerouting every 30 seconds.”\nGlobal Trade War Looms\nFears of a recession have been further compounded by the threat of a global trade war, with world leaders, including key allies, responding to Trump’s tariffs with retaliatory measures and condemnation. Canada’s Prime Minister Carney announced a 25% tariff on all US vehicle imports “that do not comply with our free trade agreement.” China fired back at Trump’s “bullying tariffs” by instituting a 34% reciprocal tariff on US imports to China effective April 10th. However, other countries are taking a different approach by negotiating with Trump to prevent an all-out trade war. UK’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is approaching the tariffs with a “calm and pragmatic approach … opting not to impose retaliatory measures.” The EU is prepared to negotiate to “remove any remaining barriers to Transatlantic trade” but is also “prepared to respond if negotiations fail,” according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The current swing towards protectionism after decades of post-WW2 globalization trade policies will only lead to political destabilization and economic hardship on a global scale. Consumers will have to bear the burden of higher prices, and economic productivity will decline because of discouraging innovation, competition, and specialization. The last time the world faced a similar situation was in the 1930s when America’s Smoot-Hawley Tariff triggered a decline in international trade and deepened the Great Depression, which may have set the conditions for the outbreak of the Second World War. This stands as an ominous historical example of the devastating consequences a full-blown trade war can have.\nWhat Does the Trump Administration Hope to Accomplish?\nTrump downplayed the effect of his tariffs, saying, “The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, and the rest of the world wants to see if there is any way they can make a deal.” However, one question on everyone’s minds amid the fallout is: What exactly does the Trump administration hope to achieve with these tariffs? To understand this, we need to take a closer look at the administration’s broader economic strategy—a plan to create a new global order, reverse deindustrialization, and eliminate trade deficits.\nReverse Deindustrialization and Trade Deficits.\nSince the 1960s, deindustrialization has devastated America’s industrial heartland. In the 1950’s, manufacturing value added (VA) accounted for 28% of output. Today, that number is only 10%. The White House stated that the tariffs would “re-shore manufacturing and drive economic growth for the American people,” the president added that “jobs and factories will come roaring back.” While reindustrializing America is a noble pursuit, the Trump administration’s vehemence on tariffs as a solution is flawed. For decades, US companies have offshored manufacturing to evade higher labor and material costs, lack of operational factories capable of mass production, and an overvalued dollar hurting exports. It is unlikely that a large share of companies will move established supply chains back to the US and run the risk of skilled worker shortages, especially in a tumultuous economic climate where countries are slapping reciprocal tariffs onto each other. Additionally, employers could harm manufacturing jobs by adapting to higher production costs and reducing consumer demand by hiring freezes or layoffs. Trump’s tariffs may end up hurting the people they intend to help.\nOn trade deficits, Trump recently emphasized aboard Air Force 1 that the US “has massive deficits and we need to straighten that out. It cannot go on any longer.” However, Trump’s belief that the US is getting ripped off with every trade deficit is a zero-sum view of how the economy works. American economist Thomas Sowell notes, “If the goods and services available to the American people are greater as a result of international trade, then Americans are wealthier, not poorer, regardless of whether there is a deficit or a surplus.” The trade deficit does not stem from countries’ ruthless exploitation, rather the US’s own role as a global hegemony.\nThe Triffin Dilemma\nIn 1959, economist Robert Triffin exposed a fundamental paradox in the US’s role as the world’s reserve currency. When the dollar was designated as the global reserve currency at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, it gained the advantages and responsibility of pulling the levers of international finance by providing liquidity to the rest of the world. However, the US must continually inject large amounts of money into circulation to keep the global economy functioning. This surges its exchange rate and makes domestic exporting industries less competitive, leading to chronic trade deficits and higher inflation within the issuer’s borders. This poses a dilemma between balancing domestic economic interests and international responsibilities. The more the US prints dollars and runs deficits, the more fragile the confidence in the dollar becomes, leading to a scenario where countries lose confidence in the stability of the dollar. Eventually, the US will be forced to choose between continuing to supply global liquidity or protecting domestic economic interests. The tariffs are the first step in a “MAGA masterplan” of a new global order in which America relinquishes itself from international responsibility to protect domestic interests. If no countries are willing to comply with this new global order, then the US will likely be left with two options: give up its role as the global reserve currency or accept deficits as part and parcel of global trade. However, in an interview with Bloomberg News in Chicago, Trump recently vowed to protect the US’s role as the global reserve currency. In this case, Trump’s plan to eliminate trade deficits with soley tariffs is implausible.\nHow MSME’s Can Navigate Uncertain Times\nIncreased production costs, consumer prices, and supply-chain disruptions caused by tariffs will likely hurt MSMEs across the United States. Here are some tips for MSME owners to navigate these challenging times and maintain stable financial health for their businesses:\nSeek professional assistance:\nOccam’s Advisory’s strategic and functional services can help you develop a customized plan to mitigate the impact of tariffs and navigate these changes confidently.\nReevaluate your supply chain:\nIf your imports come from tariff-affected countries, explore alternative suppliers in non-tariffed regions or renegotiate prices/contracts with current suppliers.\nBuild up inventory:\nTo avoid short-term cost increases, consider stocking up on essential materials now before tariffs take effect in impacted countries.\nSources/Citations\nANI. “Trump Says US Economy and Markets Will ‘Boom’ Following Reciprocal Tariff.”\nThePrint\n, theprint, 3 Apr. 2025, theprint.in/world/trump-says-us-economy-and-markets-will-boom-following-reciprocal-tariff/2577475/.

This evolution presents both novel challenges and exciting opportunities. To thrive in this new landscape, a proactive strategy is essential. Enter Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), a forward-thinking approach that focuses on crafting content not just for human consumption, but also for optimal processing and understanding by artificial intelligence, all while upholding the principles of top-tier Search Engine Optimization (SEO).\nDecoding GEO: Optimizing for the AI Era\nAt its core, GEO is a strategic evolution of traditional SEO. It recognizes that modern search engines are increasingly leveraging sophisticated AI models to understand user intent and generate direct answers or summaries. Therefore, GEO integrates established SEO best practices with a deep understanding of how these AI models analyze, interpret, and prioritize online content. By strategically applying GEO principles, businesses can ensure their content achieves dual visibility: ranking effectively in conventional search results and being prominently featured in AI-generated overviews and summaries.\nKey Strategies for GEO Success: A Holistic Approach\nTo effectively implement GEO and maintain your SEO prowess, consider these crucial strategies:\nMastering Content Fluency and Structure:\nClarity and Conciseness are Paramount:\nEmploy straightforward language, avoiding jargon or overly complex sentence structures. This ensures both human readers and AI algorithms can easily grasp the core message.\nStrategic Organization with Clear Signposts:\nStructure your content logically using descriptive headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) and subheadings. This hierarchical organization provides a clear roadmap for both readers and AI to navigate and understand the content’s key sections.\nEnhancing Readability with Visual Aids:\nUtilize bullet points and numbered lists to break down complex information into digestible segments. This improves scannability for humans and facilitates efficient information extraction for AI.\nAmplifying Trust and Authority with E-E-A-T:\nDemonstrate Comprehensive E-E-A-T:\nEmphasize Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness throughout your content. This is not just a traditional SEO recommendation but a critical factor for AI to assess the credibility and value of your information.\nShowcase Your Credibility:\nIntegrate personal anecdotes that highlight your direct experience, meticulously cite reliable and authoritative sources to back your claims, and prominently display relevant credentials, certifications, or affiliations. This builds trust with both your audience and AI algorithms.\nHarmonizing Optimization for Humans and AI:\nCraft Engaging and Understandable Content:\nWrite in a style that resonates with your target audience, maintaining clarity and interest. Avoid sacrificing human engagement for the sake of AI optimization.\nFacilitate AI Extraction with Strategic Formatting:\nEmploy concise and informative headers and subheadings that accurately reflect the content within each section. This helps AI quickly identify and extract key information for generative summaries.\nStrategically Leveraging AI in Content Creation:\nHarness AI for Foundational Tasks:\nExplore how AI tools can assist in the initial stages of content creation, such as outlining potential topics, brainstorming ideas, and conducting preliminary content analysis to identify gaps and opportunities.\nMaintain Human Oversight and Accuracy:\nRecognize that AI-generated content is a starting point, not the final product. Always subject AI-generated drafts to rigorous human editing, fact-checking, and brand voice alignment before publishing.\nThe Indispensable Role of Education and Consistency\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of generative search, continuous learning is paramount. Invest in training initiatives to educate your team on the latest GEO trends, best practices, and algorithm updates. Staying informed will enable you to adapt your strategies proactively. Furthermore, consistency is the bedrock of long-term GEO success. Maintain your commitment to traditional SEO fundamentals while seamlessly integrating GEO techniques into your ongoing content strategy. This dual approach ensures sustained visibility and relevance across both traditional and generative search environments.\nGenerative search is fundamentally reshaping how users discover and interact with online information. By proactively embracing Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and thoughtfully adapting your content strategy, your business can not only navigate this new era but also thrive within it. Remember that the key to success lies in consistently prioritizing the creation of high-quality, authoritative, and relevant content that captivates human readers while being readily understandable and valuable to AI algorithms. This balanced approach will ensure your continued visibility and competitiveness in the evolving world of search.\nWritten by Bipin Singh, Lead- Digital Marketing\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

This article provides comprehensive information about the PPP, including its benefits, eligibility criteria, and application process. By understanding the PPP, businesses can access the assistance they need to navigate challenging circumstances and ensure their financial stability.\nWhat is the Payment Protection Program?\nThe Payment Protection Program is a loan program established by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its primary objective is to help businesses retain their employees and cover essential expenses during periods of economic disruption.\nBenefits and Eligibility of the Payment Protection Program\nThe Payment Protection Program offers several benefits to eligible businesses:\n1. Loan Forgiveness: If businesses use the loan funds for approved expenses, such as payroll costs, rent, utilities, and mortgage interest, they may qualify for loan forgiveness. This means the loan amount can be entirely or partially forgiven, turning it into a grant.\n2. Financial Support: The PPP provides businesses with the financial support they need to maintain their workforce and cover essential expenses during challenging times. This helps businesses avoid layoffs, retain talent, and sustain their operations.\nReal-Life Scenarios: Businesses Benefiting from the PPP\n1. ABC Restaurant, a small family-owned business, faced financial strain due to reduced customer demand during the pandemic. By successfully obtaining a PPP loan, they were able to retain their employees, cover rent and utility costs, and continue serving their community.\n2. XYZ Retail Store experienced a significant decline in revenue and faced the possibility of permanent closure. Through the PPP, they secured the necessary funds to pay their employees, pivot their business model, and maintain their operations until the market conditions improved.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\n1. “Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)” by the Small Business Administration (SBA).

URL:\nhttps://www.uschamber.com/co/run/business-financing/covid-19-ppp-loan-application-guide\nFAQs\nHow do I determine if my business is eligible for the Payment Protection Program?\nEligibility for the PPP is based on various factors, including business size, industry, and payroll costs. Consulting with a financial advisor or referring to the official guidelines from the SBA can help determine your business’s eligibility.\nHow can I apply for the Payment Protection Program?\nTo apply for the PPP, you need to submit an application to an approved lender. The SBA website provides a list of participating lenders and the necessary forms and documentation required for the application process.\nWhat expenses can be covered by the PPP loan funds?\nThe PPP loan funds can be used for approved expenses, including payroll costs, rent, utilities, mortgage interest, and certain operational expenses. However, a portion of the loan must be used for payroll costs to qualify for full loan forgiveness.\nHow does loan forgiveness work under the Payment Protection Program?\nTo qualify for loan forgiveness, businesses must use at least 60% of the loan funds for payroll costs and the remaining 40% for eligible non-payroll expenses. They must also maintain employee headcount and salary levels during the specified period. Detailed guidelines and documentation requirements can be found on the SBA website.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Payment Protection Program (PPP) offers essential financial support to businesses during times of economic uncertainty. By understanding the benefits, eligibility criteria, and application process of the PPP, businesses can access the assistance they need to maintain their operations, retain employees, and ensure financial stability. Occam’s Advisory provides expert guidance and strategies to help businesses navigate the PPP and maximize its potential for long-term success.\nRelated Topic Blog\n3 Marketing Ideas for a Service Company\nIn certain cases, marketing a product and marketing a service are very similar: you must first recognise your clients and their interests, and then tailor your pitch to address the...\nRead More\nDriving Business Development: The Five Forces Shaping Succes...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction The Five Key Forces in Business Development  Key Factor Alert: Strategic Foundations for Business Growth  Understand the Business Development Landsca...\nRead More\nFrom Panic to Poise: Unraveling the Mystery of the IRS Audit...\nThe dreaded IRS audits.

But other common asset-protection problems that can impact their companies as well as personal properties have probably not been tackled by the same business owners. New and distinct asset-protection problems emerge as the organisation and your total wealth expand. You could be supported by the following suggestions.\nStrengthen your business and personal financial status\nWhen you face challenges with asset security, concentrate on the task of not only optimising money, but also protecting it:\nBuy protection against liability. Don't slip into a mistaken sense of confidence. A single entity's limited liability cover would not preclude the need for liability insurance, both for the corporation and for you directly. In order to defend yourself from lawsuits that allow a \"piercing of the corporate veil.\" you need individual umbrella coverage. Carefully set up sums and forms of liability coverage for your corporation tailored to its unique requirements and asset worth, as well as coverage for your assets outside the company.\nSeeking an equilibrium\nBalancing the cash needs of the organisation with your longer-term personal financial ambitions is not always straightforward. But choices in this balance will make or break your company—and your personal financial statement. Usually, rising and profitable firms require financing. Indeed to reduce its borrowing or capital needs, you will benefit from holding as much as possible of your available assets in the business. You might even lend capital back when it's required by the company.\nBe wary, however,\nRemember your personal financial interests and your desire to defend your investments from the creditors of your corporation. This is exactly why in the first place, you formed a different agency for your organisation. You have to determine if the risks and the ability for them dictate that now you are searching for other funding or investing in equity.\nBuy insurance for life\nIt's clear that with sufficient life insurance, you need to cover your company and families. And proper insurance forms and amounts will prevent the family from being compelled to sell the firm to cover future estate taxes. But don't stop there with your preparation. Bear in mind that your family might suffer crippling economic hardship from missed business profits after your death. In several cases, sufficient life insurance will help—for example, through:\nProviding funds to other owners or main workers to buy out the interest of your family,\nHeading off a cash shortage that might otherwise result in a swift selling of the firm at a deep discount\nGiving the firm the requisite time and funding to make improvements and restore it to profitability.\nGo For The Gap\nYour family and you deserve the same consideration as your company. Don't let the sun shine on your company for too long — even secure your personal assets: think shared tenancy. Try transferring possession to your partner in order to protect your home from the control of your company or personal creditors. Or instead, in states where it is an option, move to tenancy by the entirety. The surviving joint partner also immediately gets the house upon the death of the other joint tenant in this specific form of joint tenancy, but your home is safe from creditors as long as the surviving partner continues to reside there. Not the same security is provided by regular joint tenancy.\nKeep properties in distinct organisations\nYou can secure these properties to some degree from future creditors by placing real estate or financial assets into a limited partnership. They will not be able to convert their investment into cash, even though creditors can take partner interests. Or propose setting up an Alaska, Delaware or offshore trust to shield creditors from your investment funds. Assets granted to you by others such as donations or inheritances) can be more conveniently secured by trusts formed locally that maintain the interest transferred to you as a beneficiary.\nSafely Save\nRegistered savings programmes provide substantial advantages, including private retirement accounts and 401(k) plans. Contribute as far as you can afford to the legal limits and your business. You'll earn income tax savings while offering a better place to store some of your investment funds at the same time. Generally, either corporate or entity eligible schemes will not be attained by creditors. You will also be shielded from yourself by forbidden transaction laws, so they will not allow you to use eligible plan money to lend or invest in your business plans.\nGet Underway Today\nRunning an organisation needs hard work. For securing your personal and company interests, the same is real. Today, formulate and continue to analyse an asset-protection strategy as the company expands and evolves.\n#AssetSecurity #Business #LimitedLiabilityCompany #Entrepreneur #Ownership\nArticle Credits –\nwiseradvisor.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nThe Role of Collections and Customer Service in Contemporary...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Building Customer Relationships:  Effective Communication and Transparency:  Leveraging Technology for Efficiency and Personalization Driving Financi...\nRead More\nMobile Marketing: Your smartphone creates a reputation\nConsumers spend an average of 5 hours a day viewing videos, playing sports, browsing social media, or shopping on their mobile or tablet?

It goes beyond simply saving money—\nit’s about making your money work for you.\nWhether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting, understanding the power of investing can help you achieve long-term financial goals and protect your future against economic uncertainties.\nWhy Investing Matters?\nInvesting allows you to grow your wealth over time by leveraging compounding, market dynamics, and asset growth. Unlike saving, where your funds are static, investing multiplies your money by tapping into the growth of markets, businesses, or properties.\n•\nInflation Protection:\nInflation erodes the purchasing power of money. Investing helps counter this by generating returns that typically outpace inflation.\n•\nWealth Creation:\nThrough consistent investment, even small amounts grow exponentially over time, thanks to compound interest.\nFor example, investing $200 monthly with an average annual return of 8% could grow to over $120,000 in 20 years—a dramatic increase compared to keeping the same amount in a savings account.\n“The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator.”\n– Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor\nGraham’s insight highlights the importance of a disciplined, long-term approach to investing rather than chasing quick profits.\nThe Magic of Compounding\nCompounding is often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world. It works by reinvesting earnings to generate additional returns. Essentially, your money starts earning money.\nExample of Compounding:\n•\nMonthly Investment Growth:\nThe longer your investment horizon, the greater the portion of your total balance attributed to growth rather than your initial contributions.\nImagine investing\n$200 per month\nwith an annual return of\n8%.\nIn 10 years:\nYou’d accumulate approximately\n$36,000\n, of which about\n$12,000\nis growth.\nIn 20 years:\nYour investment grows to\n$120,000\n, with around\n$72,000\nbeing growth.\nIn 30 years:\nIt balloons to over\n$300,000\n, where nearly\n$228,000\ncomes from compounding.\n• Lump-Sum Investment Growth: Even a single investment can generate significant wealth with enough time.\nLet’s say you make a one-time investment of $10,000 at an annual return of 10%:\nAfter 10 years:\nYour investment grows to\n$25,937.\nAfter 20 years:\nIt reaches\n$67,275.\nAfter 30 years:\nIt skyrockets to\n$174,494.\n“Time is your friend; impulse is your enemy. Take advantage of compound interest and don’t be captivated by the siren song of the market.”\n– John C. Bogle, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing\nBogle’s words emphasize patience as the key to benefiting from the snowballing effects of compounding.\nTypes of Investments\nThe investment world offers a variety of options tailored to different financial goals and risk appetites:\n•\nStocks:\nOwnership in a company, offering high growth potential but also higher risks.\n•\nBonds:\nDebt instruments providing steady income with lower risk than stocks.\n•\nReal Estate:\nTangible assets that offer both income (through rent) and capital appreciation.\n•\nMutual Funds & ETFs:\nDiversified options for spreading risk across multiple assets.\n•\nCryptocurrency:\nA volatile but potentially high-reward emerging investment option.\nDiversifying across asset classes helps manage risk while maximizing returns.\n“The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.”\n– Philip Fisher, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits\nThis quote encourages investors to focus on the intrinsic value of assets rather than market trends.\nRisk and Reward\nAll investments come with risks, but understanding and managing those risks is crucial to success.\n•\nRisk Tolerance:\nYour financial situation, age, and goals determine how much risk you can take. Younger investors may favor riskier investments like stocks, while older individuals may lean towards safer assets like bonds.\n•\nMarket Volatility:\nMarkets fluctuate, but historically, they have shown growth over the long term. Patience and staying invested are key to weathering short-term dips.\n“The key to growing wealth is to have an investment strategy and stay the course, even during challenging times.”\n– Tony Robbins, Unshakeable\nRobbins reminds us that consistent action and resilience are crucial in the face of market volatility.\nThe Importance of Starting Early\nAll investments come with risks, but understanding and managing those risks is crucial to success.\n•\nRisk Tolerance:\nYour financial situation, age, and goals determine how much risk you can take. Younger investors may favor riskier investments like stocks, while older individuals may lean towards safer assets like bonds.\n•\nMarket Volatility:\nMarkets fluctuate, but historically, they have shown growth over the long term. Patience and staying invested are key to weathering short-term dips.\n“The key to growing wealth is to have an investment strategy and stay the course, even during challenging times.”\n– Tony Robbins, Unshakeable\nRobbins reminds us that consistent action and resilience are crucial in the face of market volatility.\nThe earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow. Consider this:\n•\nInvestor A:\nStarts investing $5,000 annually at age 25 and stops at age 35, investing for 10 years.\n•\nInvestor B:\nStarts investing $5,000 annually at age 35 and continues until age 65, investing for 30 years.\nResults at age 65\n(assuming an 8% annual return):\nInvestor A:\nDespite investing for only 10 years, Alex ends up with\n$787,180.\nInvestor B:\nDespite investing for 30 years, Ben ends up with\n$611,730.\nDespite investing for a shorter time, Investor A ends up with more money at age 65 due to the power of compounding. Time is a crucial ingredient in investment success. Starting early can result in higher wealth, even with fewer contributions, because of the longer compounding period\n“It’s not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for.”\n– Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad Poor Dad\nKiyosaki’s insight underscores the importance of putting money to work through wise investments.\nInvesting for Goals\nInvesting helps you align your money with life’s big goals:\n•\nRetirement:\nBuilding a corpus to ensure a comfortable post-retirement life.\n•\nChildren’s Education:\nPreparing for rising education costs.\n•\nBuying a Home:\nGrowing funds for down payments or full payments.\n•\nWealth Legacy:\nCreating assets to pass on to future generations.\n“The historical record suggests that the surest way to wealth is to put money aside regularly and invest it in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.”\n– Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street\nMalkiel advocates for steady, diversified investments to achieve financial goals.\nTips to Harness the Power of Investing\nTo get the most out of investing:\n•\nSet Clear Goals:\nDefine what you’re investing in.\n•\nEducate Yourself:\nUnderstand investment types and strategies.\n•\nDiversify:\nSpread investments to reduce risk.\n•\nBe Patient:\nInvesting is a long-term game.\n•\nSeek Professional Advice:\nA financial advisor can help craft a personalized plan.\n“Wealth is more often the result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and, most of all, self-discipline.”\n– Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko, The Millionaire Next Door\nThis timeless quote reminds us that discipline and planning are critical to successful investing.\nConclusion\nThe power of investing lies in its ability to grow your wealth and secure your financial future. While it requires discipline, knowledge, and patience, the rewards are transformative. Whether you’re saving for retirement, funding a dream, or building generational wealth, starting today is the best step toward financial freedom.\nMake investing a priority—it’s not just about money; it’s about creating the life you want and leaving a legacy for the next generation.\n“Money is something we trade our life energy for.”\n– Vicki Robin, Your Money or Your Life\nThis quote encapsulates the deeper meaning behind investing: to maximize the life energy you’ve exchanged for financial resources. Make investing a priority—it’s not just about money; it’s about creating the life you want and leaving a legacy for the next generation.\nWritten by Rajat Garg – Vice President Tax Credit, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Here are five different types of digital payment methods that your company can use to complete purchases.\nBusinesses and customers alike are looking for quicker, simpler, and more efficient payment options as cash becomes obsolete, and contactless transactions, particularly in light of COVID-19, are in high demand. Consumers would prefer to use five common digital payment methods in the coming years.\nWhat are the different types of digital payment services?\nContactless, cashless, and paperless payment systems are also examples of\ndigital payment services\n. Via services like smartphone applications and AI/machine learning, technology has enabled the world to accept these more accessible payment exchanges. According to Statista, the number of people who use digital payments will increase by 5.4 percent by 2020.\nDifferent types of digital payment systems are available.\nToday, a variety of digital payment methods are common. Here are five of the most common payment methods for businesses to use:\n1. Biometric identification devices\nCustomers are making more digital purchases, which raises the need for surveillance. Biometric protection protects against identity theft and fraud by using fingerprint scanners, facial recognition, iris recognition, pulse tracking, and vein visualization.\nMany phones with digital wallets, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, currently use fingerprint or facial recognition, but more options are being created. Instead of inserting a PIN code or signing a receipt, Visa is testing a biometric payment card that allows users to authenticate a transaction by pressing a sensor on the card that can decide whether the fingerprint is a match.\nPer year, over 18 billion biometric transactions are projected to take place by 2021. As a company owner, it’s important to safeguard your data as well as that of your clients, and biometric security is a promising way to accomplish those goals.\n2. Point of sale on the go (mPOS)\nBusinesses should prioritise convenient payment processing now, as there will be 27.7 million EmPOS devices by 2021, up from 3.2 million in 2014. Tablets, laptops, and other cellular gadgets that use an interface and a card reader to accept purchases like a cash register are known as mobile POS schemes.\nThis allows companies to do away with a central check-out area and take purchases from anywhere in their shop, including from off-site. You should, for example, take the payment system to a trade show or other off-site venue without thinking about how purchases will be handled. Customers will use the card reader connected to your computer to swipe their credit or debit cards and make an immediate buy – it’s that easy.\nNote from the editor: Are you looking for the best credit card processor for your company? Fill out the form below to have one of our vendor partners ask you about your requirements.\n3. Wireless speakers\nVoice instructions are no longer a far-fetched notion. Consumers may make an immediate deposit or order by using smart speakers such as Google Home, Apple HomePod, and Amazon Echo. In reality, 35% of consumers use their smart speakers to purchase items such as home care, groceries, and clothes.\nAny customers are concerned that this is not the safest way to make transactions. Nonetheless, by 2022, this digital payment pattern is expected to reach 77.9 million people (up from 18.4 million users in 2017). With this kind of development on the horizon, it’ll be critical to customise your web shop for voice search so that your company can be found using smart speakers.\n4. Payment through contactless technology\nUsers can move money, buy goods, pay bills, and complete nearly every other form of financial transaction with the tap of a finger using a variety of mobile payment applications. Purchasing products and services using a cell phone is simple and convenient when you have an account and store your payment information in it.\nVenmo (which is also useful for peer-to-peer payments), PayPal, Google Pay (previously known as Google Wallet), Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay are all examples of this technology. Allowing consumers to make electronic payments through their bank app/digital wallet or other mobile payment applications provides an unparalleled level of convenience.\nContactless payment systems come with a price tag. To begin, you’ll need to buy card terminals that support near-field communication technology. Accepting Apple Pay and Google Pay is free, but when customers use a credit card to pay for products or services in your store, premiums and fees apply much as any other credit card purchase. (These are referred to as card-present transactions.) You should inquire about these particular prices for your processor.\nMany customers choose these strategies because they believe they are simpler and faster than counting money or swiping a credit card. It’s also much easier to access for the many customers who are always using their phones.\nPhone wallets aren’t the only way to make contactless payments. RFID technology, which is used for contactless purchases, is also available on new credit cards. Customers who use a contactless credit card actually keep the card next to the card reader instead of swiping it, inserting it into a card reader, or tapping it against the terminal.\n5. Payment options on social media\nPayment options, such as exchanging money from one person to the next (P2P payments) or from customers to merchants, are also available directly within social media networks.\nWhen it comes to shopping, the majority of millennials use social media. According to an Animoto survey, a brand’s social networking visibility influences 75 percent of millennials’ buying decisions.\nFacebook, Instagram, and Pinterest all have business profiles that allow brands to sell to customers for a small price, with digital payment purchases taking place directly on the web. According to a 2018 Avionos survey, 55% of online shoppers have made a purchase through a social media site.\nConsumers have driven changes in payment systems ahead. The use of numerous alternate payment mechanisms, such as those mentioned above, will continue to grow, while the use of cash and credit cards, in particular, will continue to decline, as shown by the Avionos market survey.\n#PaymentMethods #Business #DigitalPayment #ContactlessPayment #BiometricAuthentication\nArticle Credits –\nbusiness.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nThe History of the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction R&D Timeline and Evolution  Conclusion Frequently Asked Questions CitationsIn the tapestry of economic growth and innovation, small- and medium- size...\nRead More\nUnderstanding RnD Tax Program and how SMBs can qualify for t...\nDetermine whether research and development tax credits are appropriate for your company.

In a 7-2 majority ruling, the court ruled against a Washington couple’s challenge to federal taxation on income generated from their foreign investments. Writing for the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated, “The MRT [Mandatory Repatriation Act] — which attributes the realized and undistributed income of an American-controlled foreign corporation to the entity’s American shareholders, and then taxes the American shareholders on their portions of that income — “does not exceed Congress’s constitutional authority.”\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh Struck Down Couple’s Tax Challenge Photo illustration by Slate.

However, the passage of TCJA, particularly the MRT provision, implemented a one-time tax requirement for American shareholders of profitable foreign corporations, regardless of whether those profits were repatriated back to the U.S. The act intended to offset revenue losses projected from the significant tax cuts included as another key component of TCJA and address the trillions of dollars of undistributed income that was being held by mega-corporations such as Apple, Google, and Facebook without tax consequences to American shareholders.\nA key component of TCJA was the MRT Provision (Mandatory Repatriation Tax) (Photo illustration by Freed Maxick\nhttps://blog.freedmaxick.com/summing-it-up/mandatory-repatriation-toll-tax-of-income-earned-by-controlled-foreign-entities\n)\nThe Prosecution’s Argument\nAccording to the Moores, the MRT provision went beyond congressional authority by placing taxes on unrealized income and essentially directly taxing their wealth, which according to the Sixteenth Amendment, must be apportioned among the States. Kavanaugh rejected this assertion in a footnote of his opinion, where he drew a distinction between direct taxes “imposed on persons or property” and indirect taxes such as MRT, a consumption tax “imposed on activities and transactions.” Thus, the Court’s decision upheld the Sixteenth Amendment’s provision on indirect taxes as part of income, affirming Congress’s power to “collect taxes on all incomes, from whatever source derived.”\nVictory For the Status Quo\nBefore the case ruling, there appeared to be a nervous stir among corporate America that a decision in favor of the Moore’s would send shock waves through the U.S economy by upending the tax code. A victory for the plaintiffs would have cost Washington trillions of dollars in tax revenue by rendering existing tax provisions that target unrealized income such as the CAMT, GILTI, and subpart F income unconstitutional. Additionally, a proposed global minimum tax deal named “Pillar Two,” which aims to impose a 15% tax on multinational corporations’ foreign income, would be constitutionally cumbersome to implement in the U.S. with an opposite ruling. Moreover, this decision will likely bode well for corporate taxpayers seeking certainty in how their business pays taxes. Had the ruling gone differently and MRT was deemed unconstitutional, taxpayers who filed state corporate or personal income taxes under MRT may have been eligible for protective refund claims subject to limitation periods and state policies. Ultimately, the decision in Moore has preserved the status quo and calmed a storm that threatened to dismantle the tax code.\nhttps://www.crfb.org/blogs/moore-v-us-ruling-could-widen-deficits-upend-tax-law\nGood News For the Moore Wealthy\nThat is not to say the decision does not have immediate implications, however, as progressives committed to enacting an Elizabeth Warren style wealth tax may have been dealt a final nail in the coffin when reading Kavanaugh’s opinion that makes slight suggestions on the unconstitutionality of such legislation. Based on his definition of a direct tax being applied on the wealth or “property” of an individual and an indirect tax on income derived from that wealth, a wealth tax would likely fall under the domain of a direct tax that would fail to abide by the Sixteenth Amendment’s apportionment requirement.\nSources/Citations\n1.

That moment — that instant brand recall — isn’t an accident. It’s the product of decades of deliberate, consistent storytelling. Throughout the 20th century, leading brands didn’t just capture market share; they captured imagination. They shaped the way we think about entire categories. In that era, challengers had little choice but to mimic — to look like the best in the hope of someday standing alongside them.\nBut the rules have changed.\nIn 2025, consumers don’t simply buy products. They buy meaning. They don’t see a pair of sneakers or a soda can as just merchandise — they see a reflection of values, personality, and identity. A product’s utility remains important, but it is no longer enough. What matters just as much is the story it tells, the community it signals, and the feeling it evokes. Brands today are not fighting for shelf space; they are fighting for emotional space in people’s lives.\nIf your business isn’t steering with these five objectives at the core, it’s time to reassess your strategy. Here’s what you need to know:\nA Return to Art as the Core of Branding\nIronically, at a time when marketing has become a sophisticated science of algorithms and A/B tests, the answer to deeper brand loyalty lies not in better data but in better art. This is not a return to romanticism for its own sake — it’s a strategic imperative. Historically, commerce and creativity have been intertwined. In Renaissance Europe, patrons like the Medici family commissioned art not merely for beauty, but for influence and legacy. Closer to our times, brands like Chanel, Absolut, and Coca-Cola understood that aligning with culture — through collaboration with artists and the language of visual storytelling — transcended conventional advertising.\nYet somewhere along the path to modern efficiency, branding became divorced from artistry. Scale demanded uniformity. Reach demanded simplicity. Marketing became formulaic, driven more by clicks than by culture. But culture, as ever, remains stubbornly resistant to formulas. The resurgence we are witnessing today — a shift back to brand building as an act of creativity, meaning-making, and world-building — is both inevitable and essential.\nBuilding Brands as Worlds, Not Just Products\nAt Occams Advisory, as we expanded our digital brand storytelling capabilities, it became clear that the brands poised to thrive in this new environment are those who treat creativity as infrastructure, not garnish. Investing early in thoughtful design, coherent narratives, and emotionally intelligent communication isn’t an indulgence. It’s survival. In our work across diverse industries, we’ve seen that brands who integrate storytelling deeply into their identity from day one build something far more valuable than awareness: they build belief.\nThis is why branding today demands a different kind of partnership. The era of “influencers” is giving way to an era of “co-creators.” Working with artists — illustrators, musicians, digital creators — is no longer a tactic for buzz; it’s a strategy for authenticity. Great brands aren’t borrowing someone else’s audience for a fleeting campaign; they are inviting new perspectives into their world, allowing their story to be reshaped and reimagined by creative minds. Done right, these collaborations create layers of meaning that marketing departments alone could never manufacture.\nBut even the most compelling story risks fading if it remains a one-way broadcast. Today’s strongest brands understand that real loyalty stems from community, not just consumption. Audiences can be bought with media budgets; communities are built through trust and shared values. Brands like Glossier, Aime Leon Dore, and others show us that customers don’t just want products — they want membership, participation, and co-ownership in a broader narrative. Community today isn’t a side effect of good marketing; it is the marketing.\nObserving these shifts up close — in our internal brand work and through partnerships where storytelling and design drive customer experience — reinforces a larger truth. Building a brand today is not a sprint to attention; it is an invitation to belonging. And that belonging must be earned through consistent creativity, respect for your audience’s intelligence, and an unwavering commitment to meaning over mechanics.\nFrom Transactions to Cultural Movements\nLooking ahead, the brands that will matter most won’t necessarily be the ones with the biggest ad spend or the most polished performance campaigns. They will be the ones that act more like cultural institutions than commercial enterprises — ones that use design, language, and digital experiences to spark connection, reflection, and even movement. Brands that feel like art — unpredictable, emotive, courageous — will not only thrive but define their industries.\nThe tools we have today — from digital storytelling platforms to sophisticated design ecosystems — make it easier than ever to build a brand with depth and artistry. But tools alone are not enough. What is required is intent: the intent to create something enduring, not just attention-grabbing. The intent to matter, not just to sell.\nIn a world increasingly shaped by algorithms, it’s tempting to believe that branding can be reduced to optimization. But the brands that will lead us into the next decade are those that remember what technology alone cannot replicate: the human need for beauty, meaning, and connection.\nIn the end, it is art — not marketing — that leaves a mark.\nWritten by Harsh Golani – Lead – Brand Communications, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Businesses are continually seeking innovative ways to enhance customer experiences, improve satisfaction, and boost loyalty. One of the most transformative tools available is artificial intelligence (AI). From predictive analytics to personalized interactions, AI is revolutionizing the way companies approach customer success. Let’s explore the benefits and use cases of AI in this critical area.\nBenefits of AI for Customer Success\nEnhanced Personalization\nAI allows businesses to offer highly personalized experiences by analyzing customer data to understand preferences, behaviors, and needs. This enables companies to tailor their products, services, and communications, making customers feel valued and understood.\nImproved Efficiency\nAI-driven automation can handle repetitive tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and basic customer inquiries. This not only frees up time for customer success teams to focus on more complex issues but also ensures faster and more accurate responses to customers.\nPredictive Insights\nWith AI, businesses can leverage predictive analytics to anticipate customer needs and behaviors. This can help in identifying potential churn risks, upsell opportunities, and the best times to engage customers, leading to proactive and effective customer success strategies.\n24/7 Support\nAI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide round-the-clock support, ensuring that customers receive immediate assistance regardless of the time or day. This constant availability can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and retention.\nData-Driven Decisions\nAI collects and analyzes vast amounts of customer data, providing valuable insights that drive informed decision-making. This helps businesses to continuously improve their customer success strategies based on real-time data and trends.\nUse Cases of AI in Customer Success\nPersonalized Customer Journeys\nBy analyzing customer interactions and behavior patterns, AI can create personalized customer journeys. This means that each customer receives a unique experience tailored to their specific needs and preferences, enhancing their overall satisfaction and loyalty.\nPredictive Customer Service\nAI can predict when a customer might need assistance based on their past behavior and interactions. For instance, if a customer frequently contacts support about a specific issue, AI can proactively provide solutions before the problem arises again, reducing frustration and improving the customer experience.\nAutomated Support\nChatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI can handle a wide range of customer inquiries, from answering common questions to guiding users through troubleshooting processes. This not only provides immediate support but also ensures consistency in responses, improving overall service quality.\nCustomer Sentiment Analysis\nAI can analyze customer feedback, social media mentions, and other forms of communication to gauge customer sentiment. This helps businesses understand how customers feel about their products and services, allowing them to address any issues promptly and improve customer satisfaction.\nChurn Prediction and Prevention\nBy analyzing customer data, AI can identify patterns that indicate a risk of churn. Businesses can then take proactive measures to retain these customers, such as offering personalized incentives, addressing unresolved issues, or providing additional support.\nSales and Upsell Opportunities\nAI can analyze purchasing behavior and customer preferences to identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling. By offering relevant product recommendations and personalized offers, businesses can increase their revenue while enhancing the customer experience.\nConclusion\nAI is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance customer success efforts. By providing personalized experiences, improving efficiency, offering predictive insights, and ensuring 24/7 support, AI helps businesses to build stronger, more loyal customer relationships. As AI technology continues to evolve, its potential to transform customer success strategies will only grow, making it an indispensable asset for businesses aiming to excel in customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nEmbracing AI in customer success not only positions companies for immediate gains but also sets the stage for sustained growth and competitive advantage in the future.\nWritten by\nLlajaira Soto, AVP- Client Success, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

This act mandates that many companies, including small and medium-sized businesses, disclose information about their beneficial owners, those who ultimately control or own a significant portion of the company, to the\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\n. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the CTA, its purpose, and the steps businesses need to take to comply.\nThe Purpose of the CTA: Combating Illicit Finance and Promoting Transparency\nThe CTA’s primary purpose is to combat illicit financial activities, including money laundering, tax fraud, and terrorism financing. These criminal activities often exploit opaque corporate structures to conceal the true identities of individuals behind illegal operations. By requiring disclosure of beneficial ownership information, the CTA aims to make it more difficult for criminals to hide behind shell companies and engage in financial crimes. Increased transparency allows law enforcement agencies to trace illicit funds, identify perpetrators, and dismantle criminal networks.\nWho Must File a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Report?\nThe CTA’s reporting requirements apply to a broad range of companies, categorized as either domestic or foreign reporting companies.\nDomestic Reporting Companies\nDomestic reporting companies are those formed within the United States, typically by filing documents with the Secretary of State or a similar office. This category includes corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), and other entities created through state or tribal government filings.\nExamples of domestic reporting companies:\nA Delaware Limited Liability Company\nA California For-Profit Corporation\nA Florida Homeowner’s Association\nA Texas General Partnership\nA Massachusetts Tribal Organization\nForeign Reporting Companies\nForeign reporting companies are formed under the laws of a foreign country and registered to do business in a U.S. state or tribal jurisdiction.\nExamples of foreign reporting companies:\nA Colombian LTDA registered to do business in Florida\nA Cayman Island LP registered to do business in Delaware\nA Swiss Cooperative registered to do business in New York\nExemptions from Filing a BOI Report\nWhile the CTA’s reach is extensive, the legislation recognizes that certain types of companies are already subject to significant regulatory scrutiny and disclosure requirements. Therefore, the CTA provides 23 categories of exemptions.\nThe most notable exemptions include:\nCompanies in highly regulated environments:\nThis includes entities such as banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and publicly traded companies. These entities already provide ownership information to regulatory bodies.\nCertain registered or “large” investment companies:\nInvestment companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are generally exempt, as are large investment funds that meet specific asset and investor thresholds.\nTax-exempt entities and their assisting entities:\nNon-profit organizations with 501(c) status, charities, and certain trusts are generally exempt, along with entities that support these tax-exempt organizations.\nLarge operating companies:\nCompanies with a substantial U.S. presence, defined as having:\nMore than 20 full-time employees in the U.S.\nAn operating presence at a physical office in the U.S.\nMore than $5 million in gross receipts or sales reported on the previous year’s federal tax return.\nSubsidiaries of certain exempt entities:\nSubsidiaries of companies that are already exempt, such as subsidiaries of publicly traded companies, may also be exempt from filing.\nInactive entities:\nEntities that are not actively conducting business operations are typically exempt from filing.\nIdentifying Beneficial Owners: Who They Are and What They Do\nThe CTA’s definition of a beneficial owner centers around two key concepts: substantial control and ownership interest.\nSubstantial Control\nA beneficial owner can be an individual who exercises “substantial control” over a company, even without holding a significant ownership stake.\nIndividuals who might exercise substantial control include:\nSenior officers:\nThis includes positions such as president, CEO, CFO, COO, general counsel, or other senior officers performing similar functions.\nIndividuals with appointment or removal authority:\nThose who can appoint or remove senior officers, including a majority of the board of directors, may exert substantial control.\nImportant decision makers:\nIndividuals who can influence significant company decisions, such as those involving mergers, acquisitions, major asset disposals, or changes in the nature of the business, might be deemed to have substantial control.\nOwnership Interest\nThe more straightforward definition of a beneficial owner is an individual who owns or controls at least 25% of a company’s ownership interests.\n“Ownership interests” are broadly defined to include:\nEquity, stock, or voting rights:\nThis includes traditional shares of stock, membership interests in an LLC, and other forms of ownership that grant voting rights.\nCapital or profit interests:\nThis category encompasses interests in companies structured as partnerships or LLCs, where ownership is represented by a share of profits or capital.\nConvertible instruments:\nThese are financial instruments that can be converted into equity or ownership interests in the future, such as convertible bonds or warrants.\nOptions or privileges:\nRights or agreements that give an individual the option to acquire equity or ownership interests, even if they don’t currently own them, are considered ownership interests.\nCatch-all provision:\nThe definition also includes any other contract, instrument, or mechanism established under applicable law that confers substantial control or ownership, ensuring a comprehensive scope.\nUnderstanding Company Applicants\nFor companies formed or first registered on or after January 1, 2024, the CTA introduces the concept of a “company applicant.” This refers to the individual who files the paperwork to create the company or registers a foreign company to do business in the U.S. If multiple individuals are involved in the filing process, the company applicant is typically the person primarily responsible for directing or controlling the filing.\nWhat Information Must Be Disclosed in a BOI Report?\nA BOI report requires information about both the reporting company itself and its beneficial owners and company applicants.\nReporting Company Information\nThe company section of the report requires:\nFull legal name:\nThe official, registered name of the company.\nAny trade or “doing business as” names:\nIf the company operates under a different name than its legal name.\nComplete current street address of the principal U.S. place of business:\nThis is the primary location where the company conducts business activities.\nThe state, tribal or foreign jurisdiction of formation:\nWhere the company was legally established.\nThe IRS Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN):\nFor U.S. companies, this is typically an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Foreign companies may need to provide a tax identification number issued by their home jurisdiction.\nBeneficial Owners and Company Applicants Information\nFor each beneficial owner and company applicant, the following information must be provided:\nFull legal name:\nThe individual’s complete legal name as it appears on official documents.\nDate of birth:\nThe individual’s date of birth.\nCurrent residential street address:\nThe current residential address of the individual. Company applicants acting in the course of their business should provide their business address.\nAn identifying number from an acceptable document:\nThis can be a driver’s license number, passport number, or other government-issued identification number.\nAn image of the identifying document:\nA clear copy of the document from which the identifying number was obtained is required.\nFiling Deadlines: Meeting the CTA’s Timeframes\nMeeting the CTA’s filing deadlines is crucial to avoid penalties. The deadlines vary based on the company’s formation date.\nCompanies formed or registered before January 1, 2024:\nThese companies have until\nJanuary 13, 2025,\nto file their initial BOI report.\nCompanies formed or first registered in 2024:\nThese companies must file their initial report within\n90 calendar days\nof receiving notice that their creation or registration became effective.\nOngoing Reporting Obligations: Keeping Information Current\nThe CTA’s reporting requirements are not a one-time event. Companies have a continuing obligation to keep their BOI information updated. Any changes to the information previously reported, such as changes in beneficial owners, company addresses, or control structures, must be reported to FinCEN within 30 days of the change.\nPenalties for Non-Compliance: The Consequences of Inaction\nThe CTA imposes significant penalties for failing to comply with its reporting requirements, including both civil and criminal penalties.\nCivil Penalties\nCompanies that do not file a BOI report or fail to update their information timely can face civil penalties of up to $591 for each day the violation continues, potentially resulting in substantial fines.\nCriminal Penalties\nWillful failure to report complete or updated beneficial ownership information, or providing false or fraudulent information, can lead to criminal fines of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up to two years, or both.\nHow to File a BOI Report: Options for Submission\nCompanies have two main options for filing their BOI reports.\nFinCEN’s Online Portal\nFinCEN provides a secure online portal for companies to file their BOI reports electronically. This portal is accessible through FinCEN’s website (FinCEN.gov).\nVia Occams Advisory\nAt Occams Advisory,\nour software\nBOIReporting.io\nassists companies in preparing and filing their BOI reports.\nOur self-service software automates the entire process, validating and verifying the information as you submit it. Our software also takes care of amendment and refiling services. In less than twenty minutes of your time you can save yourself from all penalties and make your business compliant.

By understanding the CTA’s requirements, identifying their beneficial owners, and meeting the filing deadlines, companies can contribute to a more secure and accountable business environment.

Rent Negotiations: Businesses may be able to negotiate more favorable rent terms with their landlords, such as rent reductions or deferrals.\n6.

Enacted by Congress to combat illicit activities such as tax fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing, the CTA requires U.S. small business owners meeting certain criteria to file a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) report to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). As the submission deadline of\nJanuary 1st, 2025\nlooms, this white paper aims to provide key information on the act’s background and offer small business owners clarity on maintaining compliance.\nBackground\nThe CTA was passed as part of a larger reform bill called The National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. At the time, CTA was not the main focus: other provisions, such as advancing AI R&D, allocating $740 billion to the Pentagon, and renaming military bases previously named after Confederate leaders garnered most of the attention among Congressmen. Nonetheless, the act was consequential as it meant the creation of a federal database tracking the beneficial ownership of U.S entities, enhancing business transparency and empowering the government to better detect and investigate concealed financial crimes. However, amid global and domestic issues such as the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and a post-election America, the act went under the radar of lawmakers and small business owners alike. Since put into effect on January 1, 2024, though, the act has required 30 million businesses to understand and comply with Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) filing requirements or face harsh penalties, including daily fines of $500, fines of up to $10,000, and up to 2 years in jail.\nUnderstanding Key CTA Terms\nReporting Company\nincludes corporations, LLCs, or similar entities registered to the business in The United States by filing a document with the Secretary of State. Thus, they are required to file a BOI report. However, 23 types of entities outlined in FinCEN’s Small Entity Compliance Guide are exempt from filing.\nBeneficial Owners\nare individuals who, directly or indirectly, have substantial control over a reporting company or own at least 25% of its ownership interests. Indirect ownership can take various forms, including convertible instruments, capital or profit interests, and equity or stock holdings.\nA company applicant\nis either: a) The individual who directly files the document that creates or registers the entity, or b) The individual who is primarily responsible for directing or controlling such filing if more than one individual is involved in the filing of the document.\n(Photo Illustration By NAIOP)\nhttps://www.naiopmd.org/news/what-to-know-about-the-corporate-transparency-act/\nReporting Requirements\nReporting companies must provide the following information about its company:\nLegal name\nTrade names\nCurrent U.S. business address:\nPrincipal place of business for U.S.-based companies\nAddress of U.S. operations for foreign companies\nJurisdiction information\nIRS taxpayer identification number (EIN / TIN).\nReporting companies must provide the following information about beneficial owners and company applicants:\nLegal name\nDate Of Birth\nCurrent Address\nAn identification document with a unique identifying number, name of the state or jurisdiction that issued the acceptable identification document, and an image of the acceptable identification document.\nWho can access my BOI report?\nIn its “Access Rule,” FinCEN has outlined the following recipients authority access a company’s BOI reports:\nFederal law enforcement agencies\nState, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies with court authorization\nFinancial institutions, with customer consent, for customer due diligence purposes\nFederal functional regulators and other appropriate regulatory agencies\nForeign law enforcement agencies, via requests made by U.S. federal agencies\nU.S. Treasury Department officials for tax administration\nSolution\nBeneficial Ownership Information (BOI)\nreporting can be a headache for businesses, but it doesn’t have to be.

Not all loans, though are produced equally and some are deemed better than others. Indeed, although debt comes in different ways, it is possible to categorise all personal debt (not corporate or government debt) into a few large categories, including secured debt, unsecured debt, revolving debt, and mortgages.\nSecured Debt\nFor collateral purposes, secured debt is any debt backed by an asset. For the lender to judge how prudent debt has been treated in the past, a credit check is required, but the asset is promised to the lender in the event that the creditor does not repay the loan. The lender has the option to seize the asset if the debt is not paid back.\nSecured debt, unsecured debt, revolving lending, and mortgages are the key forms of personal debt.\nAny type of collateral is required for secured debt, whereas unsecured debt is strictly dependent on the creditworthiness of an individual.\nA credit card is an example of unsecured revolving debt, and a protected revolving debt is a home equity line of credit.\nMortgages are mortgage loans that usually have periods of 15 to 30 years, with equity acting as the real estate.\nAn example of secured lending is an auto loan. A loan provides you with the funds required to buy it but also puts a lien, or assertion of possession, on the title of the car. The seller will repossess the vehicle and auction it in order to reclaim the funds in the event that the car buyer fails to make payments. Secured loans like these have a reasonably rational interest rate, which is normally dependent on the value of the collateral and creditworthiness.\nThe Unsecured Loans\nAny collateral lacks unsecured loans. If a loan with no asset held as collateral is made by an investor, it does so only on the confidence in the potential and promise of the borrower to repay the loan. The creditor is entitled by a binding obligation to return the cash, and the lender may go to court to recover any money owed if there is a default. Nevertheless, doing so comes at a considerable cost to the lender, and for this reason, unsecured lending typically comes at a higher rate of interest. Credit cards, signature loans, gym membership arrangements, and hospital bills are other forms of unsecured debt.\nDebt Rotating\nRevolving debt is an arrangement between a lender and a borrower which requires the consumer, on a recurring basis, to borrow an amount up to the maximum limit. Examples of revolving loans include a line of credit or a credit card. A credit card has a credit cap, and once the limit is met, the user is free to pay any amount below the limit. Revolving mortgage payment rates differ depending on the amount of funds actually on credit. As in the case of a credit card, revolving debt may be unsecured or covered, such as on a home equity line of credit.\nMortgages\nThe most popular and largest debt many consumers hold is mortgages. Mortgages are loans made for the purchase of properties, with equity acting as the subject house. Usually, a mortgage has the lowest interest rate of any personal loan option, and for those who itemise their returns, the interest is also tax deductible. Mortgage loans are often often given on 15- to 30-year contracts to keep homeowners' mortgage payments manageable.\n#Payments #SecuredDebt #UnsecuredLoans #Mortgages #DebtRevolving #InterestRate\nArticle Credits –\ninvestopedia.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nWhat is business growth and why is it important?\nFor a business, development is always healthy.

The debt stands at about $36 trillion, rising a staggering 122% since 2014 and continuing to rise rapidly. The last budget surpluses for the U.S. government came during fiscal years 1998-2001 when President Bill Clinton worked with a Republican-controlled Congress on a bipartisan budget deal to cut the deficit (Clinton White House Archives). In response to the fiscally unsustainable trend, President Trump created the Department of Government Eﬃciency, or DOGE, originally headed by billionaire tycoons Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Ramaswamy has now stepped down to pursue a run for elected oﬃce as Ohio governor. The program aims to eliminate wasteful government spending by eliminating $2 trillion from the national debt according to Musk (The Hill). This whitepaper provides an overview of how Musk and his team plan to balance the federal budget through government restructuring and reform, focusing on the spillover eﬀect DOGE could have on SME owners with government contracts.\nDOGE’s Authority\nHow will DOGE function? It is important to note that DOGE is not an oﬃcial government department, so it will not have the authority to enforce federal laws, terminate employees, and revoke regulations. Instead, DOGE will act as an advisory body to Congress and the Trump administration, identifying issues and recommending ways to reform the “slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies” (Pillsbury Law).\nSpecifically, DOGE plans to work closely with the Oﬃce of Management and Budget and the\nHouse Oversight and Accountability Committee currently under Republican control (Pillsbury Law).\nDOGE’s Plans\nDOGE will initiate three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings. They are expected to do this by:\nCutting federal regulations that are considered invalid to “slash and burn bureaucracy” according to Ramaswamy (The Hill).\nShrinking the federal workforce, leading to “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” Federal workers will be “transitioned into the private sector,” being oﬀered “incentives for early retirement and voluntary severance payments to facilitate graceful exits.” Workers will be expected to come to the oﬃce five days a week, resulting in a “wave of voluntary terminations” (Wall Street Journal).\n⅔ of the government’s $6.7 trillion budget is mandatory spending, of which Social Security and Medicare are part. The rest is discretionary spending, in which a large part is spent on defense. Musk and Ramaswamy will therefore target “$500 billion-plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended” (The Hill).\nIn an op-ed, Musk and Ramaswamy pinpointed The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, international organizations, Planned Parenthood, and “progressive groups” as places they would like to cut. Additionally, DOGE may dismantle big institutions like the IRS, USDA, FBI, DOE, and ATF.\n“Voters did not vote for incremental change, they voted for sweeping change,” Ramaswamy says (Wall Street Journal).\nHelp Wanted\nDOGE is looking for a small number of “super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.” Those interested can submit their CV or resume to DOGE’s oﬃcial account on X. The following are people across engineering, HR, IT, and finance industries who are reportedly interested in getting involved:\nWilliam McGinley, a Republican lawyer who served on the committee of the Republican National Committee\nBrad Smith, CEO of healthcare firm Russell Street Ventures who served as a health oﬃcial during Trump’s first term\nMarc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (Business Insider).\nImpact on Small to Mid-Sized Business Owners\nDOGE will likely have significant implications for SMEs with contracts with the federal government. The Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research organization based in Washington D.C., submitted recommendations to DOGE on areas to cut government. Among them was the recommendation to eliminate the Small Business Administration and contracts set aside for minorities. These changes could potentially threaten existing contracts between SME owners and the government while making the procurement process for new entrepreneurs more diﬃcult than it already is (Cato Institute; Angell). Additionally, Musk could run DOGE with volatility, making it advisable for SMEs to perhaps start exploring alternative contracting options in the private sector as well (Angell).\nHowever, DOGE could present SMEs with fruitful opportunities as well. SMEs could thrive in a scenario where the government outsources the work of these eliminated agencies to the private sector. During Reagan’s administration, work usually done by the government, such as maintaining parks and developing weaponry, was handed over to the private sector, intending for SMEs to compete for contracts and ultimately lower costs for consumers (Angell).\nParticularly, SMEs in AI should expect a critical role for them moving forward. Matt Zeiler, CEO and Founder of tech company Clarifai, notes, “If they reduce the federal workforce significantly, I think that’s going to increase the need for AI because there are still a lot of things that need to be done in the Government, that could be a big opportunity for us” (Angell).\nConcerns With DOGE\nDoubts have emerged about how Musk and his team exactly plan to make such a drastic change to the federal budget without cutting key government programs that many Americans rely on: Social Security and Medicare, which comprise 35% of the federal budget (Center for American Progress). “Two trillion dollars per year is such an absurdly large number, it’s impossible,” Senior Director of Federal Budget Policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress Bobby Kogan said. “You could only propose $2 trillion a year if you are not interested in living within reality or if you are completely callous to the major harmful eﬀects that doing that would entail.”\nEven if DOGE decides to limit these entitlement programs, they will likely receive fierce pushback from the courts. Currently, DOGE is facing legal challenges, namely, their dismantling of USAID (United States Agency for International Development). “USAID was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress,” says Virginia Congressman Don Beyer (Connolly). Additionally, many Americans are questioning if Musk and his team are overstepping their power by accessing the Treasury’s payment systems. They are unelected oﬃcials now with access to millions of Americans’ bank accounts, tax data, Social Security numbers, home addresses, and critics say that Congress is being diﬀerential to the power grab of what is meant to be an advisory board to the American Government, not an executor (Center for American Progress).\nConclusion\nWhether you argue the creation of DOGE marks a positive step in eradicating government ineﬃciencies or a blatant overreach of executive power, such a program marks an unprecedented step of an administration taking sweeping measures to fundamentally alter the nature of the administrative state. According to the Pew Research Center, 57% of Americans today say that reducing budget deficits should be a top priority, compared to 45% in 2022 (Pew Research Center). The need for the Government to balance its books is growing on the radar of Americans who fear the massive repercussions of a national debt default. While the eﬀectiveness and legality of DOGE in achieving fiscal responsibility remains to be seen, an attempt is finally being made to address what has been a long-forgotten national issue.\nWritten by Veer Agarwal\nVeer Agarwal studies at Livingston High School in the United States.\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

They may be able to achieve this growth through innovation and new technology.\nDistinct occupations have different perspectives on innovation. When it comes to accounting businesses, it is thought that technology businesses that provide accounting and associated software are a key source of innovation for the accounting profession.\nAccording to a Robert Half Management Resources poll, 41% of CFOs see technology as a key source of stress in their professions, claiming that accounting advances are moving at such a fast pace that it's impossible to stay up.\nHowever, innovation cannot be described solely in terms of technology. At your company, innovation might be characterised as:\nYour company is in the midst of a transition.\nYour company's capacity to provide services to its clientele is always improving.\nYour company's management methods and operations are always evolving.\nHow can businesses of any size innovate?\nAny company, regardless of its size, may take an innovative strategy. Accounting professionals, for the most part, take a forward-thinking approach to their work and seek to deliver services that their clients will appreciate for years to come. Another challenge is figuring out how to accomplish this without resorting to extremely unsafe or time-consuming approaches.\nAny company cannot completely transform itself overnight, nor can it devote all of its resources to improving its services and operations. Your company's approach to innovation will be largely determined by its size and resources, since innovation may be beneficial to every company, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\nOn a lesser scale, innovation\nOne of the most effective methods to seek innovation is to investigate the services you give and how you give them. There are several software solutions on the market, and you may pick the one that will make your company procedures more efficient.\nYou may start thinking about other services to give if you start doing what you're presently doing faster and more efficiently. For instance, the less time you spend on data entry activities, the more time you have to provide critical consulting services to your clients. You must consider innovations that can be implemented immediately, as opposed to those that will be implemented in the future.\nExamining the software used by your competitors is one of the most effective ways to find the same. Participate in networking organizations with businesses of similar sizes, ask questions in online forums, and attend conferences.\nSmall teams might be focused on studying the viability of new possibilities for your practice if you operate a medium-sized organization. Hiring third-party advisors that specialize in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain technology might also assist you in reaching your goals. Testing new technologies internally with your own transactions and books, regardless of the size of your company, is a terrific way to learn.\nThe innovative mindset\nFirms of all sizes and types may profit greatly by approaching innovation with an open mind and a readiness to adapt. With increased market rivalry, it's becoming increasingly difficult for businesses to grow and thrive by depending on obsolete service offerings and technology, since customers have more alternatives than ever before.\nIn various sectors of your career, innovation may take on a different meaning, yet every firm must innovate on a regular basis. Adequate steps in this area can set you apart from the competition and pave the way for long-term success.\nInnovations in Accounting Technology\nAccounting on the Cloud — In the twenty-first century, no other technology has had as big of an influence on accounting as the cloud. The capacity to handle everything from payroll and invoicing to taxes and benefits is provided by cloud apps, with automation being the most significant benefit of cloud-based accounting.\nReal-Time Reporting — As AI technology improves, accounting has understood the value of real-time reporting and the impact it has on measuring a company's financial health. The time between when an accounting event occurs and when it is recorded has been greatly reduced.\nAccounting on the Go - Accounting on the Go has reduced the need for accountants to be literally bound to their desks in order to do their jobs. Accounting businesses may now use a smartphone, laptop, or tablet to enter receipts, balance finances, generate pricey claims, and submit invoices.\nThe accounting sector has benefited immensely from\noptical character recognition (OCR) technology\n. “Advances in technology allow organizations to utilize scanners or even the cameras on mobile devices to record printed financial information like receipts and invoices and convert the text into digital files,” explains accountant Bill Gerber. “Improved accuracy has reduced the rate of mistake throughout this translation, and future upgrades are expected to boost the procedure's efficiency even more.”\nCustomer Relationship Management Software (CRM) - CRM solutions have become critical for accounting companies to stay competitive and satisfy client expectations. Companies can improve client interaction and automate boring operations by combining these systems with AI and automated solutions.\nHow can accounting businesses effectively innovate?\nAs previously said, accounting companies must innovate, and there are a few strategies that these organizations might use to do so successfully.\nDetermine your buyer group and persona – A buyer group is a broad category that includes things like manufacturers and physicians. Within that group, you must look for a persona, which is a detailed profile of your intended user. 'Members of a medical practice with 5 or fewer physicians' is an example of a persona. The trick is to be explicit.\nRecognize the market – Learn everything there is to know about the market and why it wants what you have to offer. Market research must underpin your implementation. Talk to as many people as you can, including prospects, clients, and industry experts, to learn about their needs and problem issues. It's critical to think like a customer and approach the market from the outside in, rather than the inside out.\nUse conceptual designs - To aid the customer in transforming an idea into a service or product, conceptual drawings should be employed. It may be described as a plain and plain illustration of the innovation principle. Growth, for example, may be shown as a three-legged stool, with growth as the seat and marketing, product management, and sales as the legs.\nAnalyze your market position by identifying competing products and market differentiators. One of the most dependable resources is interviewing your rivals. You will only be able to supply something that is completely enticing in the market if you conduct a thorough investigation of the competitors.\nGive your invention a name – Give your innovation approach a catchy, distinctive, and memorable name. Select a name that elucidates the purpose and value of your services. Instead of opting for 'accounting outsourcing,' you may go for something more enticing like 'concierge accounting.'\nConclusion\nAs previously said, innovation does not function on a one-size-fits-all basis, and as a result, it should be tailored to your specific business plans and needs. Implement new technology and allow yourself to be innovative in the marketplace by allowing yourself to be creative with new ideas.\n#\nAccountingFirm\n#\nTechnologyInnovations\n#\nConceptualDesigns #Cloud-BasedAccounting\nArticle Credits –\nglobalbankingandfinance.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nSection 179D Certification, Energy Efficient Commercial Buil...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction  Overview of Section 179D Deductions  Key Changes and Updates  Certification Requirements  Certificates Must Be from a Qualified Individual  Certific...\nRead More\nUnderstanding RnD Tax Program and how SMBs can qualify for t...\nDetermine whether research and development tax credits are appropriate for your company.

In this blog post, we’ll explore what cognitive bias is, how it affects business decisions, and provide strategies for overcoming it.\nIntroduction\nAs humans, we are all susceptible to cognitive biases, which are errors in thinking that can affect our decision-making processes. In a business context, these biases can lead to flawed decision-making and negative outcomes.\nWhat is Cognitive Bias?\nCognitive bias refers to the systematic errors in thinking that can occur when people process information. These biases can influence our perception, judgment, and decision-making processes, often in ways that we are not aware of. Some common types of cognitive biases include confirmation bias, availability bias, and overconfidence bias.\nExamples of Cognitive Bias in Business\nCognitive biases can manifest in a variety of ways in a business context. For example, a business owner may have an overconfidence bias and believe that their product will be a market success without conducting adequate market research. Or, they may exhibit an availability bias and make decisions based on the information that is readily available to them, rather than seeking out additional information that could provide a more complete picture.\nReal-Life Scenario #1\nLet’s say a company is considering launching a new product line. The CEO, who has an overconfidence bias, decides to go forward with the launch without conducting market research. As a result, the product fails to gain traction in the market, resulting in financial losses for the company.\nReal-Life Scenario #2\nNow let’s say a business owner has an availability bias and relies on information from a single source when making decisions. They may make a decision that is not in the best interests of the company because they are not aware of all the relevant information. For example, they may choose to partner with a supplier who is not reliable because they are not aware of other more reliable suppliers in the market.\nHow Cognitive Bias Affects Business Decisions\nCognitive bias can have a significant impact on business decisions. It can lead to flawed decision-making, which can result in missed opportunities, financial losses, and damage to a company’s reputation. For example, a business owner may have a confirmation bias and only seek out information that supports their existing beliefs, rather than considering alternative perspectives.\nOvercoming Cognitive Bias in Business\nOvercoming cognitive bias requires a conscious effort to recognize and challenge our biases. Some strategies for overcoming cognitive bias in a business context include:\nSeeking out diverse perspectives and information sources\nConducting market research and gathering data from a variety of sources\nEncouraging dissent and constructive criticism within the organization\nUsing decision-making frameworks that incorporate objective data and analysis\nPracticing mindfulness and self-reflection to recognize and challenge our own biases\nBy implementing these strategies, businesses can make more informed and objective decisions that are not influenced by cognitive biases.\nConclusion\nCognitive biases can have a significant impact on business decisions, but they can be overcome with conscious effort and awareness. By recognizing and challenging our biases, seeking out diverse perspectives and information, and using objective decision-making frameworks, businesses can make more informed and objective decisions that lead to positive outcomes.\nFAQs\nWhat is cognitive bias?\nCognitive bias refers to the systematic errors in thinking that can occur when people process information.\nHow can cognitive bias affect business decisions?\nCognitive bias can lead to flawed decision-making, which can result in missed opportunities, financial losses, and damage to a company’s reputation.\nWhat are some common types of cognitive biases?\nSome common types of cognitive biases include confirmation bias, availability bias, and overconfidence bias.\nHow can businesses overcome cognitive bias?\nBusinesses can overcome cognitive bias by seeking out diverse perspectives and information, encouraging dissent and constructive criticism, using objective decision-making frameworks, and practicing mindfulness and self-reflection to recognize and challenge their own biases.\nSchedule a no-obligation, no cost call\nwith the professional experts at Occams to help drive solutions for your business.\nSources and Citations\nHarvard Business Review: The Business Case for Curiosity (\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/09/the-business-case-for-curiosity\n)\nForbes: The 12 Cognitive Biases That Prevent You From Being Rational (\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2021/04/06/the-12-cognitive-biases-that-prevent-you-from-being-rational/?sh=4b4da9c641bb\n)\nPsychology Today: Cognitive Bias (\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-bias\n)\nRelated Topic Blog\nWhat You Need To Know About Paying Off Credit Card Debt 101\nYou're not alone in struggling to reconcile your expenditures with your duties, as over 80% of Americans are in debt.

Operational Level Strategy: Where the Magic Happens\n▷\nWhy You Can’t Afford to Ignore Any Level of Strategy\n▷\nConclusion: It’s All About Balance (And Maybe a Little Luck)\nIntroduction\nIn business, strategy is like the layers of a delicious cake — skip one, and the whole thing might crumble. Whether you’re leading a corporate giant or running a scrappy startup, having a well-baked strategy at\nall levels\nis the key to long-term success (and avoiding some serious heartburn).\nLet’s break down the\nfour distinct levels of strategy\n— Corporate, Business, Functional, and Operational — and explore how they can help turn your business into the next great success story. Oh, and to keep things light, I’ll sprinkle in a bit of humor and wisdom from some legendary business minds.\n1. Corporate Level Strategy: “Big Picture” Thinking\nThink of\nCorporate Level Strategy\nas the CEO’s crystal ball — it’s all about the\nbig picture\n, the company’s North Star. Here, the top brass (Board of Directors, C-suite folks) define the\nvision and mission\n, laying out the long-term goals of the business.\nIt’s also where companies decide if they’re going to expand into new markets or make some bold moves, like buying up a rival (or a few thousand coffee shops, if you’re Starbucks).\nKey ingredients:\nVision and Mission:\n“Where are we going?” (Hint: hopefully somewhere profitable).\nResource Allocation:\n“Who gets the money, and who gets…well, creative?”\nExpansion:\n“Are we the hunters or the hunted?”\nAs Jeff Bezos famously said, “We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details.” And who can argue with the man who started with selling books and now ships everything from toothbrushes to space rockets?\n2. Business Level Strategy: Outwit, Outplay, Outlast\nOnce the corporate vision is set, the battle begins!\nBusiness Level Strategy\nis like that game of chess you’re playing against competitors in your industry. The goal? Achieve a\ncompetitive advantage\n—whether it’s through\ndifferentiation\n(fancy word for “we’re better”),\ncost leadership\n(fancy word for “we’re cheaper”), or\nfocus strategies\n(fancy word for “we’re dominating this niche”).\nThink of this as the organization’s Game of Thrones moment—hopefully without the backstabbing (unless you count boardroom drama).\nKey moves:\nDifferentiation:\n“We’re unique” (aka the Air Jordan approach).\nCost Leadership:\n“We’re the most affordable” (aka the Walmart approach).\nFocus Strategy:\n“We own this market niche” (aka the Apple iPhone approach).\nAs Michael Porter, the granddaddy of strategy himself, once said: “The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.” In other words, you can’t dominate everywhere, but you sure can pick your battlegrounds wisely.\n3. Functional Level Strategy: The Unsung Heroes\nIf corporate strategy is the glamorous superstar and business strategy is the genius tactician, then\nFunctional Level Strategy\nis like the team behind the scenes making sure everything runs smoothly. This level focuses on individual departments—marketing, finance, HR—where each group makes sure they’re pulling their weight.\nIt’s kind of like each team is saying, “Okay, the big boss has their plan, now let’s make sure we don’t screw it up.”\nFunctional focus:\nEfficiency\nCoordination:\n“Marketing, are we cool with sales? Okay, good.”\nInnovation:\nHow do we stay one step ahead without breaking the budget?”\nTo put it in Jack Welch’s words (former CEO of General Electric): “An organization’s ability to learn, and translate that learning into action rapidly, is the ultimate competitive advantage.” The faster your teams can adapt, the better you execute!\n4. Operational Level Strategy: Where the Magic Happens\nFinally, we get to\nOperational Level Strategy\n— where the actual work gets done. This is the day-to-day grind, the trenches, where grand visions get translated into action. It’s all about\nexecution\n— making sure that every little cog in the machine is working perfectly so the bigger wheels keep turning.\nThink of this as the foundation of a house. It might not be the most glamorous part of the project, but without it, the whole thing falls apart (and quickly).\nOperational duties:\nShort-term objectives:\n“We’ve got a deadline, people!”\nResource allocation:\n“We’ve got three employees, one printer, and a dream.”\nProcess management:\n“Okay, seriously, who’s running the ship?”\nIn the words of Steve Jobs: “Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people.” It’s the teamwork at the operational level that turns strategic plans into real results.\nWhy You Can’t Afford to Ignore Any Level of Strategy\nEach of these four levels plays a vital role in the success of a business. Focusing too much on one at the expense of another can spell disaster. You might have the best operational team in the world, but without a corporate vision, you’re like a ship sailing without a compass. On the flip side, even the most inspiring corporate vision won’t save you if your operational teams can’t execute it.\nRemember, strategy isn’t just a buzzword you throw around at meetings—it’s a multi-layered approach that covers\nevery aspect\nof your business.\nConclusion: It’s All About Balance (And Maybe a Little Luck)\nCreating a successful strategy requires an understanding of\nall four levels\n. From the\nhigh-level corporate vision\nto the\nnitty-gritty day-to-day execution\n, your business needs a balance of big ideas and fine-tuned processes. Skip a level, and you’ll find yourself running in circles.\nAnd let’s face it, even if you have the perfect strategy, sometimes you just need a little luck—whether that’s being at the right place at the right time or hiring a few genius-level employees to execute your grand vision. As Henry Ford once said: “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.”\nSo, before you roll out your next big plan, ask yourself: are you giving enough attention to each level of strategy? Make sure you’re covered from top to bottom, and you might just find your business soaring to new heights (or at least avoiding any Game of Thrones-style disasters)\nWritten by\nVardhman Shah, COO, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Specifically, the IRS has begun processing approximately one million ERC claims submitted prior to the moratorium period effective September 14, 2023. The agency has already started prioritizing the compensation of small business owners who filed legitimate ERC claims while simultaneously intensifying efforts to reject improper claims and investigate cases of fraud and abuse.\nBackground\nERC was first introduced in March 2020 as part of the CARES Act, a $2 trillion economic relief bill in response to COVID-19. ERC was specifically designed for small business owners affected by the pandemic with employees still on the payroll. Initially, Congress budgeted just $83 billion to hand out in ERC payments but ended up distributing $230 billion, nearly triple the estimate. Driven by “aggressive marketing by nefarious actors,” small business owners uninformed of ERC’s requirements were enticed to file claims by promoters who falsely promised entitlements. When the IRS noticed an influx of ERC claims dubious in validity, they placed a moratorium on further claims in September 2023 to review existing ones. A review of 1 million claims worth over $86 billion revealed that 10-20% were high-risk and improper, 60-70% had an “unacceptable” level of risk—not enough to process or deny the claim–and 10-20% were low risk and safe for payment processing.\nResumption of Claims\n10-20% of claims that were categorized as low risk by the IRS have begun being processed starting late summer 2024. Meanwhile, the IRS is currently conducting further review of 60 to 70% of the claims categorized as an unacceptable level of risk and has started outright denying the rest with a high risk. Additionally, they have rolled back their claims-processing moratorium and announced on August 8th that “it will now start judiciously processing claims filed between Sept 14, 2023, and Jan 31,2024,” prioritizing “the highest and lowest risk claims at the top and bottom of the spectrum” where there is a “sound basis to pay or deny a refund claim.” As per the recent update, 28,000 disallowance letters have been issued to claimants of high risk, thousands of audits and hundreds of criminal cases are underway, and 50,000 claimants of low risk are on the fast track for payment processing in the coming weeks.\nLaunch of Second ERC VDP\nMore recently, on August 15, 2024, the IRS announced a second Employee Retention Credit Voluntary Disclosure Program (ERC-VDP) to allow businesses with potentially erroneous ERC claims the opportunity to repay 85%, or keep 15%, of the claimed credit without incurring penalties or interest, applications due by November 22, 2024. To be eligible, employers must have already received the ERC refund or credit for 2021, but those under criminal investigation, facing employment tax examinations, or already notified by the IRS about repayment obligations are excluded from participating. The program requires participants to disclose information about their tax preparers, potentially aiding the IRS in identifying abusive practices. Participation in the program does not shield businesses from future criminal investigations related to their ERC claims and prosecution.\n(Occams Advisory Marketing Here)\nTotal ERC Amount Filed – $365,637,028\nTotal # of claims filed – 1208\nAverage Amount per claim – $302,680\nSources/Citations\n1.

Over the years, I’ve witnessed the internet evolve from a mere information repository to an interconnected, AI-infused organism that influences every aspect of our lives. Yet, in the midst of this rapid progress, one question lingers—are we truly innovating, or are we merely iterating?\nWeb Development: Breaking the Cycle of Incremental Change\nFor decades, the web has been shaped by incremental improvements—better UI frameworks, faster front-end libraries, more scalable back-end solutions. But at its core, are we genuinely challenging the fundamental principles of how the web operates? The original vision of the internet was decentralized, permissionless, and open. Yet, we’ve drifted into a reality dominated by walled gardens, data monopolies, and corporate-controlled ecosystems.\nFront-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte have made development smoother, but do they push the web forward or just make it slightly more efficient? We celebrate real-time interactions powered by WebAssembly and server-side rendering, yet we still rely on the same centralized models for hosting, authentication, and data ownership. What if we could rebuild the web with user autonomy at its core?\nBeyond the Page: The Web as an Intelligent Entity\nThe web is no longer a collection of pages—it’s an ecosystem that learns, adapts, and predicts. Businesses are shifting from building static websites to creating dynamic, AI-driven experiences that blur the lines between digital and reality. The rise of generative AI is pushing this further—soon, websites won’t just respond to users; they will anticipate their needs, generating personalized content in real-time.\nAnd yet, this raises a critical issue—if AI is shaping our web experiences, who controls the narrative? Algorithms dictate search results, content feeds, and even the very information we consume. As developers, we hold immense power to either reinforce these invisible biases or actively fight against them by promoting transparency and ethical AI practices.\nDecentralization: Will It Free the Web or Fracture It?\nThe promise of Web3 and blockchain was to return power to the users, giving them control over their data and digital identities. However, the reality has been far more complex. While decentralized technologies present an alternative to centralized control, they also introduce new challenges—scalability, usability, and environmental impact. Are we trading one set of gatekeepers for another?\nWe must ask ourselves—how can we leverage decentralization to build a fairer internet without compromising usability? True innovation lies in bridging the gap between decentralized principles and real-world accessibility, making blockchain-powered applications as seamless as traditional web experiences.\nAI in Development: A Double-Edged Sword\nAI is no longer just a tool—it’s becoming a co-developer. From GitHub Copilot writing boilerplate code to AI-driven testing suites optimizing performance, automation is revolutionizing the development process. But at what cost? If AI can write, debug, and even design applications, will developers become obsolete, or will we evolve into architects of higher-order systems?\nThe challenge ahead is not just about harnessing AI—it’s about maintaining creativity in an era of automation. We must resist the temptation to let AI replace human ingenuity and instead use it to amplify our ability to think beyond conventions, push boundaries, and create something truly revolutionary.\nThe Next Era: A Web Without Limits\nThe web has never been static. It’s constantly reshaping itself, adapting to new demands, and forcing us to rethink our role as developers. The modern era of composable architectures, headless CMS platforms, and microservices-driven infrastructures offers unprecedented flexibility. But should we be content with flexibility alone, or should we be thinking even bigger?\nWhat if the future of web development isn’t about building sites but about crafting entirely new digital realities? Virtual worlds, persistent online spaces, and AI-driven personal assistants that seamlessly integrate into our lives—these aren’t sci-fi fantasies anymore, they’re within reach. The challenge is no longer just about writing efficient code—it’s about reshaping the very concept of what the web is.\nFinal Thoughts: The Responsibility of Innovation\nAs developers, we are not just coders. We are architects of the digital age, and with that power comes responsibility. The decisions we make today—about AI, decentralization, ethics, and automation—will shape the internet for generations to come. Are we content with making the web marginally better, or will we dare to reinvent it?\nIf we are to step into this new era of web development, let’s do it with purpose. Let’s build not just for efficiency, but for impact. Let’s stop iterating and start revolutionizing.\nWritten by Vijay Prajapati, Sr. Software Developer, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

Financial services and technology are inextricably linked, bringing with them both upheaval and synergy.\nFintech start-ups are attracting the attention of financial institutions, who are either investing in them or forming strategic relationships with them. According to McKinsey Panorama, over 80% of financial institutions have formed fintech collaborations. Meanwhile, worldwide venture capital (VC) fintech investment hit $30.8 billion in 2018, up from $1.8 billion in 2011.\nWhile technology advancements appear to be defining a brighter future for certain firms in the post-COVID age, FinTech continues to grow and change the financial services sector environment. It’s all about remaining ahead of the curve in this battle to capture a larger share of the market amid dwindling consumer and company confidence, since improved technology adoption can be the secret sauce for attracting and maintaining consumers in the digital age.\nAsset management, insurance, and lending firms are just a few of the important areas of the larger financial sector that have embraced the latest digital technology with vigour. While the COVID-19 epidemic originally drove the investment banking (IB) industry to its knees, recent developments in financial technology adoption appear to be helping them get back on their feet, owing to improved and simplified M&A advising, risk management, and financial asset management solutions.\nWe’ve all heard of Fintech Version 1.0 and Fintech Version 2.0, but the current philosophy around financial technology investment doesn’t stop there. A variety of elements can push and pull IB thematics while channelling the way technology can slither through and provide a spin to each and every product and service in the Investment Banking market. When it comes to risk profiling, lending, fraud analysis, and payments, tech-based end-to-end models look to take things to the next level. Let’s have a look at how this is accomplished in today’s world:\nPenetration of AI Technology – The ‘New Normal’: Fintech adoption in IB models is paving the way for new growth opportunities in the financial services sector, assuring cost-effective due diligence, increasing the value of M&A possibilities, expediting legal checks, and advancing asset-reporting inconsistencies in acquisition agreements. Furthermore, AI-enabled actuarial software is giving a strong push toward providing top-notch, quicker, and more accurate risk advising services.\nFurthermore, the seamless use and penetration of AI and ML in\nalgorithm trading\n, stock market prediction, fraud detection and prevention, client acquisition, risk profiling, and network security merits praise. Technology-enabled valuation models play an essential role in carving out future stock forecasts and assisting smart investment judgments in the face of COVID-induced market volatility.\nValue-Based Offerings are Powered by Big Data Analytics- Big data models are increasingly being used by IBs to evolve and provide sophisticated solutions, such as creating customer-centric asset portfolio valuation models, trading and investment assistance, risk advising, and M&A help. Meanwhile, big data is being used to improve internal operations like automated customer service, salary optimization, attrition modelling, fraud analysis, and credit/operational risks, among others.\nFurthermore, algorithm trading appears to be gaining traction among big IB companies as a means of assuring efficient financial transaction execution and sound investment selections without the need for human interaction.\nAdoption of innovative prediction models, advanced statistical approaches, and guaranteeing privacy and data integration are all essential in the IB area. To guarantee that big data enhances competitiveness and supports wider market penetration, a specific set of issues must be properly addressed.\nThe Next-Generation Frontier:\nRobo Advisory\nuses high-tech algorithms to give online investment management platforms with safe, quicker, and self-service capabilities. According to market analysts, in the post-COVID era, asset under management utilising Robo Advisory is anticipated to increase by a factor of ten.\nRobo Advisory provides for automated changes and rebalancing of portfolio allocation based on algorithms and pre-defined investing criteria with little manual work. The investments are fully automated and have self-learning algorithms, and the cost of operating a robotic automation tool is far lower than performing the same tasks manually.\nThe Immediate Future of Cashless Transactions: In the face of the present health crisis, IBs are able to improve and supplement existing goods and services, as well as establish new business models, thanks to the greater comfort and safety connected with online cash-less transactions. While social isolation is becoming the new normal in the wake of the coronavirus, financial advisers appear to be reaping the benefits of technological advancements and more cashless transactions.\nWithout a question, financial behemoths who are first to adopt digital technology have an advantage over their competitors. However, the most significant problem for FinTech is data privacy, as digital transactions are particularly vulnerable to hackers. Nonetheless, in the near future, the digital transition may witness the rise of a digital-first paradigm, assuring a fundamental shift in the value proposition given to customers, with a growing emphasis on digital toolkits and electronic market access. Overall, it’s about how companies refine their transformation goals, incorporate lessons gained from the epidemic, and assess their overall strategic agenda.\n” This blog offers generic information.

In an industry where advancements are critical, the Research & Development (R&D) Tax Credit offers a substantial incentive for manufacturers to invest in new technologies and processes. However, many manufacturers are either unaware of the full potential of this credit or unsure how to navigate the complexities involved. In this detailed guide, we aim to shed light on how manufacturing activities qualify for the R&D credit and offer practical insights to maximize these benefits.\nThe Strategic Importance of the R&D Tax Credit\nThe R&D Tax Credit, under IRC §41, is designed to reward companies for innovation. For manufacturers, this means substantial tax savings for activities that push the boundaries of what’s possible. This credit not only fuels innovation but also provides the financial flexibility needed to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\nDiving Deep into Qualifying Activities\nManufacturers often overlook the wide array of activities that qualify for the R&D tax credit. Here’s a closer look at some specific activities that can qualify:\n1.\nProduct Innovation and Enhancement:\nDeveloping a new product or significantly enhancing an existing one, such as improving durability, efficiency, or sustainability.\n2.\nAdvanced Manufacturing Processes:\nCreating new production processes or refining existing ones to improve quality control, reduce costs, or increase output.\n3.\nPrototype Development:\nThe iterative process of designing, creating, and testing prototypes, including small-batch trial runs to evaluate feasibility.\n4.\nIntegration of Cutting-Edge Technologies:\nImplementing advanced technologies such as AI, IoT, or robotics to enhance manufacturing capabilities.\n5.\nMaterial Science Advancements:\nExperimenting with innovative materials to achieve better performance, reduce environmental impact, or cut costs.\nKey Criteria for Qualifying R&D Activities\nTo ensure your manufacturing activities qualify for the R&D tax credit, they must meet these critical criteria:\n1.\nTechnological in Nature:\nActivities must be grounded in engineering, physical or biological sciences, or computer science.\n2.\nElimination of Uncertainty:\nProjects must aim to resolve technical uncertainties, such as determining if a product or process can be improved or created.\n3.\nSystematic Process of Experimentation:\nMust include a systematic approach to experimentation, including trials and prototypes, to resolve uncertainties.\n4.\nQualified Purpose:\nThe intent should be to develop or improve the functionality, performance, reliability, or quality of a product, process, or software.\nMaximizing the R&D Tax Credit: Practical Steps\nTo leverage the R&D tax credit fully, manufacturers should take the following strategic steps:\n1.\nDetailed Documentation:\nKeep meticulous records of R&D activities. This includes project plans, timelines, technical drawings, testing protocols, and outcomes.\n2.\nExpense Tracking:\nAccurately track all qualified research expenses (QREs), such as wages for R&D staff, cost of supplies used in research, and third-party contractor costs.\n3.\nLeverage Technology:\nUse specialized software to track and document R&D activities and expenses in real-time, ensuring no qualifying activity goes undocumented.\n4.\nEngage Experts:\nCollaborate with tax advisors who specialize in R&D tax credits. They can help identify qualifying activities, ensure compliance, and maximize your claim.\nThe Broader Benefits of the R&D Tax Credit\nThe benefits of the R&D tax credit extend beyond immediate tax savings:\n1.\nIncreased Innovation Capacity:\nFinancial resources saved through the credit can be reinvested in further research and development.\n2.\nEnhanced Competitive Edge:\nContinuous innovation helps manufacturers stay ahead of competitors and respond to market changes swiftly.\n3.\nSustainable Growth:\nBy funding ongoing innovation, manufacturers can drive long-term growth and sustainability.\nConclusion\nAt Occams Advisory, our mission is to empower manufacturers to unlock the full potential of the R&D tax credit. By understanding the nuances of qualifying activities and maintaining rigorous documentation, manufacturers can realize substantial financial benefits and drive continuous innovation.

At Occams Advisory, we believe that our strength lies not just in our expertise but in the partnerships that we cultivate. Our collaborations with affiliates, clients, and strategic partners empower us to provide comprehensive, innovative solutions that help our clients flourish. As the VP of Affiliate Origination & Management at Occams Advisory, I have experienced firsthand how impactful strategic partnerships can be.\nWhy Partnerships Matter\nIn this ever-changing environment, no organization can thrive alone. Partnerships are essential for expanding reach, diversifying solutions, and enhancing service quality. By leveraging one another’s strengths, partners can fill gaps, drive necessary innovation, and unlock mutual growth. At Occams Advisory, we seek partnerships that align with our core values and complement our services, such as tax solutions, business or personal finances, and specialized consulting. Our affiliates extend our capabilities, enabling us to meet client needs holistically and deliver superior results. This also enhances affiliate relationships with their clients by providing additional resources that they would otherwise not have access to.\nKey Benefits of Strong Partnerships\nEnhanced Expertise and Resources\nPartnering with specialists, such as CPAs, Wealth Managers, Insurance Experts, Lending Partners and other industry experts, allows us to identify areas where clients need immediate results by using our evidence-based approach and our delivery of customized solutions.For instance, our collaboration with tax filing professionals enables us to share our expertise in tax credits, amendments, and other complex financial strategies to their clients, elevating the value that they already provide. Leveraging our lending partners to assist in capital raising when the client needs funds or guiding them to restore and enhance her credit standing to its optimal state is another way that clients benefit from our strategic partnerships.\nShared Goals and Shared Success\nPartnerships are most effective when both parties are working toward a common goal. At Occams Advisory, we emphasize shared success. By creating win-win scenarios, we motivate each partner to invest fully in the relationship, fostering collaboration that benefits all stakeholders. And most importantly, getting our mutual clients the solutions they need to be successful.\nInnovative Solutions for Evolving Needs\nThe business environment is constantly changing, and so are our clients’ needs. Through our partnerships, we can quickly adapt, offering flexible solutions that respond to these emerging challenges. Adaptability has been crucial in providing timely, relevant support, such as expedited ERC (Employee Retention Credit) claims, during recent economic shifts.\nMutual Trust and Long-Term Growth\nSustainable growth is built on trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to excellence. Our partnerships are not just transactional—they are founded on trust and mutual respect, ensuring that each partnership is an opportunity for long-term success. As we look for legacy clients to work with us through each of their business cycles’ needs, we strive for partnerships that are legacy affiliates as well.\nThe Fundamentals\nBuilding and Nurturing Strategic Partnerships\nCreating impactful partnerships starts with finding alliances who share our values and vision. For Occams Advisory, that means identifying and aligning with organizations and affiliates who prioritize integrity, client service, and innovation. As we continue to grow, cultivating these relationships remains at the heart of our mission, allowing us to support our clients’ goals and foster a powerful, interconnected network of expertise. These are simple, back to basics that we continue to foster in our growth.\nLooking Ahead\nWe have all heard the saying that “the future of business belongs to those who build bridges, not walls.” This is also true as we focus on partnerships that enable organizations to innovate faster, reach farther, and achieve more than they could independently. At Occams Advisory, we are proud to be part of a network of exceptional partners, all working to make a difference in the lives of our clients and in the broader business community.If you know a CPA, a financial consultant, or a specialist looking to bring expertise to a\nwider audience, we invite you to encourage them to explore the power of a partnership with us. I believe that together, we can achieve remarkable results and redefine what is possible.\nWritten by\nAmber E Kellogg, VP – Affiliate Origination & Management, Occams Advisory\nCheck out our website:\nwww.occamsadvisory.com\nor Schedule a free consultation:\nhttps://bit.ly/3X6era9\nThis blog is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as any professional advice.

This is where the accounts for merchants come in. The middleman that allows firms to take credit and debit cards in person and online is simply a dealer account. But why are they a required feature of accepting debit cards and credit cards, and in order to process electronic payments, does your company really need one?\nHere is a brief overview of how a merchant account runs, what to look for in a merchant account, and how it can be acquired by small companies. Check out our\nCredit Card Processing Buyer's Guide\nfor a more in-depth look at merchant accounts, which will also help you figure out why your company wants a merchant account and how to find the best one for your company.\nWhat is an account for a merchant ?\nA retailer account acts as an interface between the bank accounts of consumers and the bank account of your corporation when electronic transfers are handled, including credit card transactions. The merchant account works behind the scenes after a transaction to transfer funds from the customer's bank and deposit them directly into the checking account of the firm. During a refund, the mechanism works the same way.\nYou can start making credit card and debit card transactions with your customers until a payment processor has set up a merchant account for your company. Usually, you would still require some hardware to do so, which could be available for purchase from your credit card processing partner. In certain cases, to help you get started, the payment provider might also give you a free credit card reader.\nHow making payments functions ?\nInformation must be submitted to a payment gateway after a credit card request is accepted to see whether the cardholder has adequate funds. This is normally part of the point-of - sale (POS) computer for typical purchases that reads the data of the cardholder and checks with the credit card issuer to ensure that the transaction can go through. This is known as a form of merchant account, \"swiped\" or \"card-present,\" which may include grocery, restaurant or lodging merchants.\nCard-present purchases are known to be the least vulnerable to theft in general. This means that the prices related to these purchases are also the lowest provided by credit card processors. Card-present transactions, however, are not the only way to accept a client's credit card payments.\nVia a payment portal, which ties to the credit card business, a \"keyed-in\" or \"wallet-not-present\" purchase is made electronically. A payment gateway is required by any company that wants to take credit cards over the phone or through an online portal. If your clients often put pickup orders ahead of time, you may also hire a payment gateway.\nAt the same time that your merchant account is created, the credit card processor you partner with will set up a payment gateway for you. However, payment gateways typically cost an extra monthly charge, and transactions with card-not-present generally have higher prices than transactions with card-present.\nFor e-commerce firms, payment service and merchant accounts\nThe payment processing business has expanded its scope to e-commerce companies as companies have gone increasingly digital. Since it is not possible to accept cash or checks electronically, e-commerce businesses are in far more dire need of payment processing systems than brick and mortar firms. The kinds of retailer accounts open to e-commerce firms, though, are distinct from those for brick-and - mortar shops. Any of the forms are these:\nDirect\n: A direct merchant account would be demanded directly from a merchant bank.\nLocal\n: In one's home country, a local merchant account is an account.\nOffshore\n: An offshore merchant account is also known as an overseas merchant account and is based outside the merchant's country.\nHigh-risk\n: A high-risk retailer account is meant for high-percentage chargebacks and returns for online companies.\nThird-party\n: Linked to a direct credit card payment processor through an external protected payment portal, a third-party merchant account contributes to the processor's function, covering the expenses. For new e-commerce firms, this type is perfect.\nGenerally, at the time of payment or repayment, merchant purchases are not reported to the record. During the merchant's settlement process, these transactions are normally listed in a batch. The arbitration process may either be personally implemented or scheduled to occur at a given time of day, depending on the organisation and the individual payment gateway.\nHow to get an account with a merchant\nA corporation has to apply and be accepted to get a merchant account. Credit card providers ensure that a cardholder is eligible to receive a promised good or service, i.e. the cardholder is eligible to their money back if the good or service is not provided. This further mitigates the burden the credit card issuer faces as one of the most important concepts of consumer security. Any time it performs a credit card transaction with your company, the payment processor has the opportunity to lose money. Thus, any entities who want a merchant account must apply, and there is a fee for this often.\nWhen applying for these merchant accounts, it's important for companies to remain grounded in reality. When you apply, it should be possible for your prospective processor to have specific answers about the type of paperwork expected and how long the approval process will take. It 's important to be suspicious and have a second look at the business if the processor makes unreasonable blanket pledges or claims.\nIt 's important to have the financial records when applying for a merchant account in order to take advantage of the best available acceptance terms. Another useful asset that you can use to maximise your application is a good development background. To explain just what the company does and why it merits a merchant account, you should use an old-fashioned cover note.\nWhat costs are paid in respect of merchant accounts?\nThe costs associated with a merchant account vary from provider to provider. Merchant accounts, in some situations, stick to a set per-transaction payment that comes without any extra costs. Others utilise a business scheme with interchange-plus, which is the payment cost of the credit card issuer plus the markup of the retailer account supplier. Finally, there is the tiered pricing model, which, based on the type of purchase, provides many different prices.\nFor each model, here's a closer look.\nFlat-rate pricing\n: The flat-rate pricing approach is most widely used by mobile credit card processing and is easy to understand. You are paid a set amount for any transaction processed. For instance, the processor could take 3 percent of the value of the transaction each time you swipe a debit or credit card. For companies with poor market rates or small-ticket items, this model is ideal.\nInterchange-plus pricing\n: For small companies, this is one of the most popular pricing models. The payment rate set by the credit card issuer is the interchange rate. This rate plus a margin as a benefit would be paid by a payment processor in interchange-plus pricing. An interchange-plus price system , for example, may appear as \"2.75 percent + $0.10 per contract.\" In this example, the 10 cents are the discount of the processor, while the interchange cost is 2.75 percent.\nTiered pricing\n: Tiered pricing splits transactions into three classifications: qualified, non-qualified and mid-qualified transactions. The most favourable rate is granted to eligible transactions, while the most costly are non-qualified transactions. The types of purchases differ in each group, but you would usually consider an eligible transaction to be a card-present transaction at the point of sale with a standard credit or debit card, whereas a smartphone keyed-in credit card number will normally be non-skilled. Mid-qualified transactions might require keyed-in card numbers using an Address Verification Service (AVS) in order to validate the additional identification address of the cardholder.\nThere are some extra costs beyond the templates of pricing:\nMonthly fee\n: The monthly fee is paid for the processing of the monthly statement and the availability of customer service, often referred to as a statement fee.\nGateway charge\n: You could incur a monthly gateway charge if you use a payment gateway for card-not-present or online purchases.\nMinimum monthly fee\n: Certain payment providers have a certain amount or volume of transactions that you are expected to make per month. You will be entitled to a monthly subscription fee if you fail to reach this subscription.\nPCI enforcement fee\n: To reduce the threat of identity theft and fraud, the Payment Card Industry has\ncomputer protection legislation\n. As part of setting up and managing your vendor account, several payment providers will assist you to remain legal. For these facilities, certain processors charge PCI approval fees, although they are not often disclosed when you ask about rates.\nPCI non-compliance fee\n: For companies who do not conform with PCI requirements, certain processors incur penalties. Usually, you have to come into line a few months after signing up, and if you neglect to do so within the timeframe, you could start incurring PCI non-compliance fees.\nBatch fee\n: Anytime you upload a batch of new purchases, you could be paid a batch fee, which is normally once or twice a day. Usually, these rates are the same as your per-transaction fee, about 10 or 25 cents.\nAddress verification service fee\n: If you are using AVS to validate the address of a cardholder, the processor can charge you this fee. AVS is a metric of fraud protection most widely used by e-commerce firms and enterprises who carry out keyed-in transactions regularly.\nRetrieval cost\n: When a buyer challenges a charge and their bank demands the documents relating to the sale in question, you may be paid a retrieval cost. This is not the same as a chargeback fee; a c could eventually prevent the retrieval.\nChargeback fee\n: Chargeback payments result when consumers challenge a charge effectively and seek a refund. Chargebacks include cancelling a contract that is already made and returning the money to the client. To offset the payment costs involved with the reimbursement, you then have to pay the company a fee.\nCross-border costs\n: In general, international transfers come with extra costs to offset the expense of electronically transferring currency.\nAny payments are inevitable, but not all are common among the industry's credit card processors. To make sure you are not swept up with fake bills from a shady payment processor, do your due diligence.\nYou need a Marchant account if you want to accept credit cards.\nThe bottom line is, if you wish to accept debit and credit cards from your clients, you need to secure a merchant account. Many clients anticipate the opportunity to pay by card in today's world; many don't even bring cash on a regular basis. Refusing to set up a merchant account so that you can accept these types of payments could annoy your clients and potentially lose your company.\nArticle Credits –\nbusinessnewsdaily.com\n#MerchantAccount #ProcessingPayment #EcommerceBusinesses #InternetnationalCharges\nRelated Topic Blog\nSynergy In Finance With The Collaboration Of Human Intellige...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Benefits of AI in Finance Challenges to be considered Conclusion    Introduction The finance world is changing at a rapid pace with new technologies...\nRead More\nRisk to Business\nWhat is corporate risk?

However, some company owners go so far in the opposite direction, wasting too much time running their business, focusing on their business, and reinvesting money into their business that they ignore their personal finances.\nYou've probably seen founders like this before—they're smart businesspeople, but they don't manage their own capital well.\nA surprising number of company owners, who are among the toughest workers on the planet, get a little careless in their personal finances: they overspend, don't save enough for retirement, and make unnecessarily risky investments (or make the mistake of parking their money in the bank and earning 0 percent interest).\nIt helps to be smart about your personal finances if you're a company owner. Here are few helpful tips and tactics for making smart financial decisions in your personal life. Indeed, you will discover that improving your personal finances will assist you in becoming more competitive in your company.\n1. Put money together for an accident.\nAccording to financial advisors, having three to six months' worth of living costs (after taxes) in an\nemergency savings fund\nis a safe rule of thumb. Are you up for it? If you own a corporation, you will want to create an even bigger emergency fund in case your company experiences a slowdown or has seasonal cash flow variations.\nWhat if you lose your most important customer and had to reduce your salary? How long do you think your personal emergency fund will last? Hold the emergency fund in an\nFDIC-insured cash bank account\nrather than losing money in the bond exchange or locking it up in long-term CDs. You aren't looking for a high return on this money; you just need it to be available in an emergency.\nGetting an emergency fund would give you more peace of mind, helping you to make more informed business decisions. You'll be able to focus more on running your business if you feel your family is safe in the event of a financial tragedy (car crash, big house repairs, natural catastrophe, medical bills).\n2. Take care of your personal credit.\nA small business's lifeblood is credit, so make sure your personal credit is in decent condition as well. And sure you pay your bills on time. And if budget is scarce and you can only afford to make a minimum credit card charge, it's preferable to skip a payment or pay late.\nOften, keep an eye on your credit usage level, which is the amount of the total credit limits that you're using at any given time during the month. If you can keep this ratio below 30%, you'll have a higher credit score and have an easier time getting personal loans accepted.\nHaving better personal credit can also benefit your business, particularly if you're still creating credit in your company's name. Keeping track of your mortgage balances and due dates will also help you build a solid financial base.\n3. Put money together for retirement.\nSmall business owners also reinvest a large portion of their earnings back into the company, but there are some excellent ways for them to prepare for retirement. Even if you don't have any workers, consider setting up a\nSEP IRA\nor other tax-advantaged retirement savings account for your company.\nYou can find that as a self-employed citizen, you can save more money for retirement than you will as an employee, based on your salary and other qualified factors.\nSaving for retirement will help you diversify your investments into a broader range of investment opportunities, such as stocks, shares, ETFs, and money market mutual funds, rather than pouring all of your earnings back into your company. Your organization is now your most valuable commodity. Your income and insurance are already reliant on your company. You don't have to put every penny back into your company; you can also invest in a wider variety of opportunities.\n4. Invest in accordance with your risk profile.\nMake sure you're invested in a diversified portfolio of investments that are suitable for your time span and risk tolerance after you've begun preparing for retirement. If you are still relatively young and have many decades until retirement, you should focus your portfolio on stocks.\nFor example, an old asset allocation rule of thumb was that you should divide your age by 100 to calculate the proportion of your portfolio that should be invested in stocks. So, if you were 40 years old, you would deduct 40 from 100 to get your portfolio, which would result in you spending 60% of your money in stocks and 40% in bonds and currency.\nHowever, based on your financial priorities, you will choose to devote a higher proportion of your portfolio to stocks so that you can benefit from their long-term growth prospects before you retire. Stocks are expensive, but they usually have the highest long-term return opportunities.\n5. Seek specialist assistance\nFor more detailed guidance, contact a financial adviser; this column does not constitute legitimate financial advice, but it can help you work about some of your choices so you can make well-informed financial decisions.\nYou would be more likely to be able to concentrate on running your business with a relaxed and optimistic outlook if you can boost your personal finances—with a solid emergency fund, good personal credit, and a diversified portfolio of investment funds apart from the equity that you own in your business. And for company owners, who are among the busiest individuals on the planet, getting financial peace of mind can be absolutely invaluable.\n#FinanceTips #SavingsFund #SmallBusiness #InvestmentGoals #RetirementSavings\nArticle Credits –\nforbes.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nNavigating the 2025 Tax Season: Key Changes, Deadlines, and...\nBlog At A Glance: Background Extension or Expiration of TCJA?

While the Trump administration’s arrival was not expected to immediately trigger sweeping changes this tax season, events such as the resignation of IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel on Inauguration Day and the unusual delays in IRS website updates signaled early shifts ahead (“What To Know About The Not-So-Usual 2025 Tax Season”). As the Department of Government Efficiency aggressively pursues mass layoffs within the IRS, debates ensue over the extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), and BOI reporting under FinCEN has been terminated, SME owners may struggle to navigate this flurry of changes on top of regular tax planning. This whitepaper explores these developments further and their impact on tax filing and planning for SME owners, as well as the comprehensive tax solutions and bookkeeping services that Occams Advisory offers to help businesses stay compliant in these uncertain times while maximizing available benefits.\nExtension or Expiration of TCJA?\nOne consequential fiscal policy initiative Donald Trump undertook during his first term was signing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) into law in 2017, a comprehensive tax reform package that delivered cuts to pass-through businesses, corporations, and individuals. However, the TCJA is set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress takes action. Key provisions of the TCJA that concern SMEs include: (“What New Tax Policies Mean for Small Businesses”).\nBonus depreciation that gradually reduced from 100% in 2017 to 40% this year will return to 100% if the TCJA is extended. Bonus depreciation incentivizes SMEs to invest in their businesses and significantly or entirely remove the cost of qualifying assets.\nQualified Business Income Deduction (QBI) of 20% for sole proprietorships or pass-through entities like S-corps.\nTax credit (Section 45S) for employers offering up to 12 weeks of paid family and sick leave to employees.\nCapital gains tax cuts for SMEs investing in underserved communities federally designated as Opportunity Zones.\nIndividual tax cuts for SME owners reporting business income on personal taxes.\nEven though the cuts to businesses are substantial, Democratic lawmakers and other critics argue that the top 1 percent of income earners in the United States disproportionately benefited from them. According to the Wall Street Journal, there is more than a $60,000 difference in cuts between the top 1 percent and bottom quintile of income earners. Additionally, fully renewing the TCJA is projected to cost the government $5.5 trillion in deficit spending and increase net interest outlays by $467 billion (“How Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts Actually Played Out”).\nRepublican lawmakers’ plan is to use the reconciliation process to extend the TCJA which would bypass filibusters and require just a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate (“Will Trump and Congress Extend TCJA Tax Cuts?”).\nThe expiration of certain TCJA provisions may bring significant tax changes, but SME owners do not have to navigate them alone. With Occams Advisory’s expertise in tax filing and planning, you can stay compliant with confidence— allowing you to focus on running core business operations.\nTermination of BOI\nPresident Trump and the U.S. Treasury have recently announced that the Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) filing requirement to FinCEN under the Corporate Transparency Act has been terminated. This news will likely come to the relief of SME owners who found the requirement burdensome and stress-inducing because of complex regulations, having to give out sensitive information, and the threat of heavy fines. The termination comes after a federal district court in Texas blocked the enforcement of BOI and FinCEN granted a 30-day extension until March 21st. However, there is a slim possibility that the CTA will come back to life if the Supreme Court upholds the law in the fall and the Treasury Department is forced to enforce it. SME owners should be on the lookout for such updates (“BOI Filing Requirement is Officially Dead!”).\nIRS Mass Layoffs\nAs part of cost-cutting measures by the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk’s agency has recently called for the axing of 6,000 IRS employees, with reports suggesting that number can go up to half its workforce. Here is how the tax returns of SME owners and individuals could be impacted: (“IRS Layoffs 2025: How Businesses Will Feel the Impact”).\nProcessing Delays:\nFormer IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig stated, “There should not be a significant impact on current filing season operations.” However, with the broad nature of the layoffs, taxpayers could face processing delays on their returns.\nReduced Customer Support:\nTaxpayers could have to wait longer for assistance with fewer staff available to pick up calls.\nAudit Delays:\nAuditing officers at the IRS have declined over the past decade. Additional layoffs would further inhibit their ability to detect tax fraud.\nChallenging verification process:\nBusinesses seeking verification letters such as the S-corp election could face delays in obtaining them.\nUpcoming Deadlines\nA flurry of tax changes makes it all the more important for SME owners to be secure on the upcoming regular deadlines first:\nMarch 17th, 2025:\nTaxes due for businesses set up as partnerships such as S-corps and multi-member LLCs.\nApril 15th, 2025:\nTaxes due for C-corps.\nSeptember 15th, 2025:\nFinal deadline for S-corps and partnerships that applied for an extension.\nOctober 15th, 2025:\nFinal deadline for C-corps that applied for an extension.\nNote: The following list is a general overview of deadlines for businesses.

As an entrepreneur, here's how to stay on top of your finances.\nAs a small business owner, there are many hats you ought to wear. Marketing your company, recruiting the right staff, and establishing relationships with your clients would be part of your duties. You need to keep track of the earnings and corporate accounting on top of all this.\nAccounting is certainly not your hobby, but it's important for your small company to keep your books organized. Accounting is the language of financial growth, turning a variety of different figures into an accessible market profitability message.\nAccounting usually involves tracking, summarizing and reviewing a business's financial transactions. This can be daunting in itself, but small business owners have to resolve other common financial hurdles. Here are 12 of the top accounting issues that firms need to face, and how to solve them.\nFlux of currency\nFor small firms and businesses, controlling cash flow is a major obstacle. The U.S., according to a Bank analysis, a staggering 82% of firms who collapse do so because of cash flow concerns. It is difficult for small business owners to earmark money to offset recurring expenses to keep the organization going.\nTo keep on top of cash flow, thoroughly examine the bills and be meticulous in chasing consumer payments.\nExpenses unexpected\nIt can appear to be in decent health if a retail store receives $150,000 per year after losses, before a slip-and-fall lawsuit loses the store $1.3 million and it has no insurance coverage. Even reduced rates, such as a one-time government levy on all companies in a given area or an increase in the cost of products, will bring about dramatic improvements in the bottom line.\nTo control your small-term costs, maximize your current credit, but also watch your long-term performance to ensure that cost increases do not threaten your overall liquidity.\nPreparedness for Crises\nThere are catastrophic consequences on lives and industries from unpredictable natural disasters, but they strike small businesses particularly hard.\nYou may have prepared some disaster relief plans, but after a devastating accident, you need to have cash on hand to ensure that you can restart your business. [Read a similar article: From COVID-19 to Hurricane Season: Small Business Emergency Preparedness]\nThe Taxes\nAny U.S. corporation needs to pay taxes, so you will reduce the bill come Tax Day by taking advantage of deductions.\nIf your small company is home-based, deductions from home offices are necessary for handling your earnings. Section 179 of the tax code requires you to subtract the expense of commercial property depreciation immediately, as stated by the National Federation of Independent Company. Therefore, it is possible to reinvest the investment expense into your company.\nPayroll handling\nFor a small business owner, playing the role of an HR or payroll specialist may be challenging. You could run into expensive fines if you don't know how to correctly identify your new workers.\nIn an Ernst & Young report, 85 percent of the corporations surveyed say their payroll process had potential for change. Organizational dysfunction, including irregular tax reporting, late and underdue fees, incompatible software, employee absence monitoring, enforcement problems, and administrative burden, were the most popular issues.\nStaying on top of costs\nIt can be extremely difficult to keep track of the receipts and recurring costs, but keeping lists of expenses is necessary for small companies to remain ahead of the competition.\nLuckily, all paper receipts must no longer be kept in a filing cabinet or box to be processed later. There are several solutions on the market for accounting applications that will allow you to go paperless. However, each software is different, so do your homework to find the one that best meets the needs of your organization. [Need assistance finding the best group accounting software? Check out our top choices and recommendations.]\nGetting the books reconciled\nIt can be an annoying job to close your accounts, especially without developing a proper accounting system. It is possible to make an error that can lead to faulty estimates, misleading data processing, and even\nIRS audits\n, so checking all the company activities on a monthly basis, if not on a weekly or regular basis, is important. At the end of each day, you may want to make it a habit of reading through your accounting books when the expenses are still fresh in your mind.\nAnalysis of the financials\nIt takes three steps to make a sound financial decision: interpreting, assessing and informing. Regardless of the reports you use, only the first step is to produce the statistics. Really, what do those numbers mean? More significantly, how are you developing them? These statistics must be understood and evaluated to guide you to the right recommendations and decisions. Through doing this, you will boost your market financial position and discover the loopholes that impact the growth of your company.\nAttempt to do DIY accounting\nDoing it alone is the habit of many owners of small businesses, but when it comes to accounting, that can be expensive. You may be an expert, but not in bookkeeping, in making a certain commodity or delivering a service. And if you can balance your accounts, because you do not leave it to the pros, it's easy to make mistakes. If invoices go unpaid, it might lead to a loss of profits; you could run into cash flow difficulties, or you might end up overpaying taxes.\nHiring a trained bookkeeper or contracting accounting to a specialist would guarantee that the books are up-to-date and exact, reflecting the company's true state. A second pair of eyes on your books will decrease the chance of errors and help you find possibilities for cost savings and growth. It will also save you time you can spend on expanding your company.\nTechnology accepting\nThe old forms of accounting may be pencil and paper or Excel spreadsheets, but for small business owners, these are still standard practices. They've been doing things that way for years, so why will they change now?\nCloud accounting tools can streamline business processes and help you recognize growth factors, reduce the time it takes for the transactions to be reported and reconciled, and reduce errors. Many\ncloud-based accounting systems\nbill you annually, including revenue monitoring, budget preparation, cash control, financial reporting, payroll and tax management, and giving you access to a plethora of resources.\nUsing tools for accounting to the fullest\nFor small business owners, the amount of features and functions in accounting software may be overwhelming, but that doesn't mean they can be ignored. The software for cloud accounting is strong, offering actionable insights about your business. You will cut back on the time it takes to enter data and run reports by studying the app and educating the employees on it.\nSweating little items\nYou must document and categorize everything, including the smallest expenditures and transfers, to get the most detailed image of the finances of the organization. Every month, it is also important to conduct an audit of the books and accounts and run daily reports. The easier it would be to find faults or places to grow, the better your bookkeeping method and your supervision of it. You can get a straightforward and consistent image of the health of your company only by honest and thorough accounting and reporting.\nAvoiding errors in accounting\nSelecting the best accountant is an extremely critical job for small companies. An professional accountant or CPA will help your company escape all the accounting errors listed above and guide you about how to expand your company in this agile market.\nIt may be expensive to employ an in-house accountant, but having a trained specialist on board at an early stage is crucial. Outsourcing your finance and accounting needs will be a feasible, inexpensive way to cope with these difficulties more efficiently whether you are a small business owner or start-up meeting these or other accounting issues, so you can return to working on what you know best.\n#AccountingChallenges #SmallBusinesses #UnexpectedExpenses #TAX #AnalyzingFinances\nArticle Credits –\nbusiness.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nTrump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”: What It Means for Smal...\nTrump’s sweeping 2025 tax-and-spending law expanding cuts and control, aiming to simplify policy under a single massive bill, though critics warn it centralizes too much power in W...\nRead More\nHow Occams Advisory Can Unlock Your Innovation Potential Wit...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Real-World Success Stories Frequently Asked Questions Conclusion  Sources and Citations   Introduction Fueling innovation is the lifeblood of busines...\nRead More\nOptimizing Client Relations with AI in 2025\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction   Customer Experience: The New Competitive Advantage  The Strategic Path Forward   Final Thoughts Introduction In today’s ultra-competitive market, w...\nRead More",

According to updated forecasts provided on Wednesday, almost all of them anticipate raising rates to between 4% and 4.5% by the end of this year, which would need substantial rate increases at policy meetings in November and December.\n“We have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn’t,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the rate decision.\nThe stock markets fell after a choppy trading day. The S&P 500 index as a whole decreased 66 points, or 1.7%, to 3789.93. The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield According to Tradeweb, the Treasury note finished around 3.993% from 3.962% on Tuesday, which is almost a 15-year high. Immediately following the Fed’s statement, it reached a peak of 4.12%. In the meantime, longer-term Treasury yields decreased because rising rates could cause an even more severe economic downturn.\nOfficials predicted that rate increases would continue until 2023, with the majority predicting that the fed-funds rate would stabilize at 4.6% by the end of the following year. That was more than the 3.8% that they had anticipated in June.\nAnalysts said they hadn’t expected the Fed to show quite so high an endpoint for the rate. Given how persistently elevated inflation has been, “I wouldn’t be surprised to see them go even higher than what they’ve written down—say, to 5%,” said Ellen Meade, an economist at Duke University who is a former senior adviser at the Fed.\nThe predictions for what might occur after next year indicated a wide range. A third of officials believe that the fed funds rate will remain at 4% until 2024, while others believe that rate reductions will continue.\n“There is a message here that rates will stay higher for longer, and this message is really sticking with market participants,” said Blerina Uruci, U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price.\nEven though the economy isn’t yet showing the full effects of Fed rate increases, “all of this volatility and uncertainty makes it hard for businesses to make plans. There are some benefits to having this hiking of interest rates over and done with sooner,” she said.\nThe Federal Reserve was buying mortgage-backed and Treasury securities a year ago, indicating that rates might remain at zero for an additional year. The strength of the economy’s recovery from the pandemic and the rate of inflation’s increase were both underestimated by officials.\nThey have authorized rate rises at five straight policy meetings after starting to raise the fed-funds rate from nearly zero in March, making this the fastest rate increase since the 1980s. The Fed hadn’t increased interest rates by 0.75 points before June since 1994.\nA market bounce was sparked by officials raising interest rates for a second time in July while also expressing increased worries about going overboard. Investor confidence regarding how rapidly inflation would drop also contributed to the market boom.\nThe Fed’s efforts to slow the economy and decrease price pressures were threatened by the rally, and Mr. Powell gave a direct speech last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to emphasize the Fed’s commitment to doing so.\nTo limit further confusion, on Wednesday, Mr. Powell prefaced his answers to reporters’ questions with a disclaimer. “My main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole,” he said.\nThroughout his press conference, “what Chair Powell was trying to do was keep to a minimum the biggest risks to getting inflation to come down—which was market participants getting ahead of themselves and actually easing financial conditions,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon.\nThe chance that the Fed will raise rates excessively and send the economy into a recession increases as it does so. But Mr. Powell highlighted numerous times the importance of reducing inflation now in order to prevent a later recession that is far worse.\n“No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession will be,” he said. “We certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment. Nonetheless, we need to complete this task.”\nIn May and June, the economy slowed down, but through the summer, it seemed to pick up speed. According to Mr. Powell, the Fed wanted to see further proof that the labor market was cooling off on Wednesday. Over the previous six months, the economy has added 380,000 jobs on average per month, considerably beyond the 50,000 jobs per month that economists believe would maintain the unemployment rate at its current level.\nWhile data on inflation haven’t gotten worse this summer, they also haven’t improved in the way that the Fed and many economists had hoped. Although total inflation decreased in July and August as a result of falling gas prices, rising housing costs and the cost of services like dental and medical care, haircuts, and auto repairs have kept inflation high.\nIn contrast to June’s gain of 9.1%, a four-decade high, the consumer price index increased by 8.3% from a year earlier in August. Mr. Powell cited how, despite waning supply-chain issues, inflation using a different gauge has persistently run at a rate of 4.5% or higher.\n“That’s not where we expected or wanted to be,” he said. “Our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down largely because of supply-side healing. By now we would have thought that we would have seen some of that. We haven’t.”\nAccording to Fed experts, the unemployment rate will increase to 4.4% in 2019 from 3.7% in August and 3.5% in July. A recession has typically followed an increase of such size throughout that time period.\nAccording to a number of analysts, including Ms. Meade and Ms. Uruci, it seems improbable that the Fed could reduce inflation to 3% next year and 2% by 2025 without further harming the labor market.\nAt the same time, Mr. Powell appeared to be more candid about the risks. “He is using words that are open to recession,” said Ms. Meade.\nThe potential of tighter credit has hurt the U.S. mortgage market, as the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.25% last week from 6.01% the week before, according to data released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association. It reached its highest point since October 2008. Loan requests to buy homes decreased 30% from the same week previous year.\nMr. Powell said it was likely the housing market, which boomed during the pandemic, driving prices to new highs, would weaken significantly. Mr. Reinhart said the admission was notable because the economy has always entered a recession when the housing sector has contracted.\n“They want to convey that policy will be firm and that the economy will suffer as a result. It’s hard for them to say how much it will suffer,” said Mr. Reinhart.\nRelated Topic Blog\nHow Occams Advisory Helped a Local SME Maximize Tax Advantag...\nBlog At A Glance: Client Challenge Solution Results Client Testimonial ConclusionClient: B**N*A Logistics (Logistics) Challenges: Many small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) stru...\nRead More\nHow Can Video Marketing Help SaaS Companies?\nVideo marketing is considered the way of the future by many marketers.

But in a bad economy, they can be the kiss of death.\nSo if you're trying to come up with money to cover your bills on time during the slump, then these four ways to easily cure cash flow issues could come in handy.\n1. Eliminate needless costs for company\nPull your bank accounts out. Pull out your receipts with your credit card. Whose costs are you aware of?\nLook at recurring monthly costs you should cut for the best return on investment.\nIn any industry, there are always several company tool subscriptions, newsletter subscriptions, and programme subscriptions.\nAnd I will bet at least 5% to 15% of these are no longer being used or fulfilling their original function. Identify those, and automatically cancel them.\nThis little workout alone will improve your cash flow and save you a couple of thousand dollars a year.\nReplacing costly services with cheaper services is another convenient way to cut costs. Substitute your landline phone with a paid Skype account, for example. Or find an open\nsource solution free of charge to supplement a paying solution.\nYou would be shocked by how many fine, inexpensive resources are available to you until you start investigating. (If you need help getting started, just ask your social network.)\n2. Faster Invoice, Slower Pay Bills\nYou have to do whatever you can to change the cycle when cash is streaming out quicker than it comes in. Since you ultimately want the money to pass out slowly than it comes in.\nAn simple way to do this is to raise more easily, then \"float\" the money on invoices.\nSo, for example:\nSee if you can get your consumers to pay faster if you usually invoice on Net 30 terms. Offer them a tiny discount, say 14 days, to pay the whole sum up front or within a shorter time period.\nThe quicker you get paid, the better it will be for your cash flow.\nHolding your capital as long as possible is the second stage in the process. But that means you're going to continue to try to postpone paying your suppliers.\nFor a single invoice, you can apply for terms or ask for an extension. Or you could consider paying with a credit card if you'd like not to deal with vendors.\nYou will automatically get an additional 25-30 days to pay for paying for a credit card. (Just make sure by the end of the billing period that you have enough cash to pay off the balance.)\n3. Tasks that are not the biggest and greatest use of your resources Outsource\nIf you do data entry where you can do jobs worth $1,000 an hour, so it adds to the cash flow concerns.\nIf you are still stuck in your company doing menial jobs, you will never have time to work on your project.\nYou need to work on doing activities that improve the monetary worth of your talents all of the time. A reliable freelance worker should be outsourced to any assignment that comes outside of the highest-value skill set.\nFor example, you could hire a Virtual Assistant (VA) to take care of some of the boring and repetitive things you have to perform on a daily basis if you are a lone entrepreneur.\nOr to screen phone calls, take messages, and book appointments, you may contract with a firm. This alone could save a few hours a week conservatively, freeing you up to do the stuff that creates more sales and more profit.\n4. Don't let the cash balance ruin a good month\nIf you've ever had a very good business month, so you know exactly how fun it can be. You know how enticing it can be to go out and buy the pricey thing for which you have been lusting.\nThere's a piece of advice here: don't buy the stuff.\nHolding your thoughts in place.\nWhen times are healthy, put aside enough cash so you can comfortably weather the tough months that may (or may not) come in the future.\nThis recommendation is, sadly, not generally pursued. Only look at the guys overseeing massive releases of items. The cash inflow encourages them to do dumb stuff… like buying expensive six-figure sports cars and 10,000 square foot bachelor pads.\nThis is an incredible fault.\nSince one good month doesn't make for a good year. For future profits, previous success is no certainty. The economic conditions of today are not tomorrow's economic conditions. Etc, and so forth, etc.\nIt will very easily drag down your company if you get financially over-committed in your personal life.\nMany who are able to forgo a luxurious lifestyle so that they can make smart investments and keep their firms going smoothly are the most prosperous business men (and women) I've met.\nThe most affluent are perhaps some of the most frugal.\nIt is the entrepreneurs who run lean operations who endure difficult times and gain longevity in their respective markets, even though the cash flow is good.\nEmploy these four methods for market optimization… be deliberate about applying them in your business… and you can easily cure your cash flow problems.\n#PayingSolution #CashFlowChallenges #ResourcesOutsource #Entrepreneurs\nArticle Credits –\nryanhealy.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nHow Occams Advisory Can Unlock Your Innovation Potential Wit...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Real-World Success Stories Frequently Asked Questions Conclusion  Sources and Citations   Introduction Fueling innovation is the lifeblood of busines...\nRead More\n2020: The year that has shaken Fintech\nIt seems like a lifetime ago that Visa revealed it was buying Plaid for a whopping $5bn, a Californian fintech based on banking infrastructure.

At the price tag, Fintech pundits swooned, and the cynics stood up.\nBut within the next 12 months, not one but two curveballs were presented to the fintech market.\nCovid came in first.\nJobs have been slashed, investors have slowed and development has dived. In the early days, serious, existential questions arose; how does this continue in the Fintech space? Who's winning? Who wants assistance? What happens to the expected expansions, releases, and recruitment of joys that blocked the mailbox of reporters months ago?\nThen came the fall of Wirecard in the autumn.\nEuropean fintech was thrown into the toughest weekend of 2020 by the UK closure of the payment processor; an inglorious title made a year of endless gloomy moments all the more pronounced.\nBut the fintech sector will finish 2020 stronger than it began the year, unlike others (broadly speaking).\nIndeed, Fintech has retained the trust of customers, nurtured its reputation, and propelled its journey to prominence in the online transition.\nIt has also moved widely from saying that it \"revolutionises the lives of consumers\" in the name of financial services to a more practical stance of delivering smart infrastructure.\nIn comparison to the two big hiccups in 2020, these crowning successes will seep into next year, triggering a welcome wake-up call and more focused Fintech spending.\nThat doesn't mean that the past year was the most creative, inspirational or smooth, to be clear. Nor was it free, not by a long shot, of casualties.\nI'm still in no hurry to proclaim that 2021 will be a 'fintech year'.\nFintech, instead, simply endured the first true major test. The big take-away should be that.\nHere's a rundown of Sifted's 7 top fintech headlines, scoops, and research from the last 12 months to tie up this unforgettable year, and to lead you through 2021.\n1. The end of Bó, the ineffective automated bank\nUK bank RBS invested over £ 100 million on Bo, the automated bank retail programme.\nBut over internal politics and flawed implementation, it crashed in May.\nThe statement at the height of the lockdown indicated that the news was all but forgotten and forgiven. But RBS will give a lesson to other major banks how not to experiment, and fintechs will give a cause to celebrate…\n2. The enigmatic investor in Fintech\nWe love to dive under the radar at Sifted and report on little-known people secretly pulling the puppet strings in the European start-up market.\n3. Why will this Fintech group be the next Unicorns?\nA deep-dive into the highly dynamic, fast-growing army of banking platforms.\nThe backend operators who secretly rent out their banking networks to power your pre-paid cards and loan applications are this group of Fintechs (known as 'banking as a service' players).\nOver the next five years, investors expect them to become profitable, billion-dollar firms, so it's a place to watch.\nThis also feeds into another Sifted survey that finds that\nB2B fintech investment\nin 2020 overtook B2C investment!\n4. The boom of the 'fin-fluencer'\nUsing influencers to promote their products, inside the online tactics of customer fintech, who carry their marketing push to social media.\n5. Tandem's drop\nTandem was once identified as the darlings of British Fintech alongside Monzo, Starling, and Revolut.\nBut after announcing the end of its\nconsumer credit card programme\n, 2020 firmly ended Tandem's reign as one of the 'top 10 digital banks' in the UK. This was part of a big turnaround announced by Sifted, which Tandem's new owners told us was to make the firm a specialist lender rather than a savvy consumer bank.\nOh, and far from being a unicorn, Tandem was given a ~£90m valuation by the new buy-in.\n6. Spain: Fintech's Magnet for Women\nSifted has also taken the opportunity to compare the statistics available on the inclusion of women among fintech companies across different European countries. We found some surprising outcomes and identified the leading women in executive positions\n7. Here comes the second wave of digital banks.\nA new generation of consumer fintech is on the horizon, and their predecessors are attempting a radically different business approach.\nIn view of accumulating losses at older digital banks, we shed light on how entrants rely on viability and niche services rather than \"growth at all costs.\"\n#Finetech #BankingInfrastructure #Wirecard #B2CInvestment #Tandem\nArticle Credits –\nsifted.eu\nRelated Topic Blog\nWhat is an Investment Banking and What Does It Mean?\nInvestment banking is a branch of banking that specializes on assisting individuals and businesses in raising cash and providing financial advice.

The legal structure you select can impact your company’s liability, taxes, ownership, and overall operations. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the importance of selecting the right legal structure and provide key considerations to help you make an informed decision. Whether you’re starting a new venture or reevaluating your current structure, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to pick the right legal framework for your company’s success.\nHow to Pick the Right Legal Structure for Your Company\nChoosing the right legal structure is a crucial step in establishing and running your company. The legal structure you select will have significant implications for taxation, liability, ownership, and governance. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore key considerations and provide expert tips to help you navigate the complex process of choosing the right legal structure for your business.\nImportance of Choosing the Right Legal Structure\nSelecting the appropriate legal structure is essential for several reasons:\n1. Liability Protection: Certain legal structures provide personal liability protection, shielding business owners from personal financial risk in case of legal issues or debts.\n2. Tax Implications: Different legal structures have varying tax implications. Understanding the tax benefits and obligations associated with each structure is crucial for optimizing your company’s financials.\n3. Ownership and Governance: Legal structures determine how ownership is distributed and how decisions are made within the company. The right structure will align with your desired ownership and management structure.\nKey Considerations for Selecting a Legal Structure\nWhen choosing a legal structure for your company, consider the following:\n1. Business Type and Goals: Assess the nature of your business, its growth potential, and long-term goals. Consider factors such as scalability, exit strategies, and potential changes in ownership.\n2. Liability and Risk: Evaluate the level of personal liability you are willing to assume. Some structures, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations, offer protection against personal liability.\n3. Tax Considerations: Understand the tax implications associated with each legal structure. Consult with a tax advisor to determine the structure that best aligns with your financial goals.\nReal-Life Scenarios: Examples of Legal Structures for Different Businesses\n1. ABC Tech Startup: ABC Tech, a software development startup, opted for a Limited Liability Company (LLC) structure due to its flexibility, limited liability protection, and pass-through taxation benefits. This structure allowed them to attract investors and protect personal assets.\n2.

In contrast, a corporation is a separate legal entity with shareholders, offering limited liability protection.\nCan I change my legal structure in the future?\nYes, it is possible to change the legal structure of your company as it evolves. However, it may involve legal and tax implications. Consult with a legal professional or business advisor before making any changes.\nWhich legal structure is most suitable for a small business?\nThe most suitable legal structure for a small business depends on various factors such as liability protection, tax considerations, and the desired management structure. Common options include sole proprietorships, LLCs, and partnerships.\nDo I need to consult an attorney when selecting a legal structure?\nWhile not mandatory, consulting with an attorney or business advisor who specializes in business formations can provide valuable guidance and ensure that you choose the most appropriate legal structure for your company.\nConclusion\nChoosing the right legal structure for your company is a crucial step in its formation and growth. By considering factors such as liability protection, tax implications, and ownership structure, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your business goals.\nRemember, seeking guidance from legal professionals and business advisors can provide valuable insights and ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Regularly reassessing your legal structure as your business evolves is also important to adapt to changing needs and optimize your operations.\nWith the right legal structure in place, you can enjoy the benefits of reduced liability, tax advantages, and a solid foundation for long-term growth. Take the time to evaluate your options, weigh the pros and cons, and make a decision that positions your company for success.\nSources and Citations\n1. “How to Pick the Right Legal Structure for Your Business” by the U.S. Small Business Administration.

Introduction: A Strategic Milestone\nWe are thrilled to announce the inauguration of our new office in New Delhi, marking a significant milestone in our mission to foster innovation at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and finance. This expansion not only strengthens our presence in India’s capital but also reinforces our commitment to driving transformative change within the global financial sector.\nWalking into the new office felt like watching a vision take shape—brick by brick, dream by dream. As\nSunny Shekhar, Lead – Product\n, reflected,\n“Meeting the incredible people I’ve worked with virtually for so long was genuinely special, and it reminded me why we do what we do: to build something meaningful together.”\n2. The Roundtable: AI and the Future of Finance\nTo commemorate the opening, we hosted an exclusive AI-Finance Roundtable, bringing together industry leaders, technologists, and policymakers. The discussion explored the evolving role of AI in financial services, from risk modelling and compliance automation to smarter investment strategies. The event underscored the importance of cross-sector collaboration in shaping the future of finance.\n“The AI-Finance Roundtable was not just a milestone event—it was a manifestation of our brand ethos: clarity, collaboration, and future-forward thinking,” said\nHarsh Golani, Lead – Brand Communications.\n“Launching our New Delhi office amidst such thought leadership signals our commitment to shaping conversations that matter in finance and technology.”\n3. India’s Position in the Global AI Landscape\nWhile the U.S. and Europe currently lead in AI adoption, India’s demographic and economic dynamics position it as a rapidly emerging player in this space. With its growing pool of technical talent and a flourishing startup ecosystem, India offers unique opportunities to create AI solutions that are globally relevant and locally grounded. Our New Delhi office is designed to harness this potential.\nPriyanka Bathwal, Vice President – Finance,\nnoted,\n“Spending quality time with my own team and engaging with colleagues from other departments brought a renewed sense of energy. The day was filled with meaningful conversations, shared laughter, and a collective excitement for what lies ahead.”\n4.

The New Delhi office has been envisioned as a hub for knowledge exchange and co-creation, designed to cultivate meaningful collaborations with academic institutions, startups, and established enterprises. By fostering such a dynamic ecosystem, we aim to accelerate the development of AI-powered tools that have the potential to redefine the financial landscape—both in India and globally.\nThe inauguration event served as a testament to this vision.\nZidane Zafar, Assistant Creative Director – Design\n, reflected on the occasion, stating,\n“The energy, the smiles, and the sense of togetherness made it a memorable day. Events like these reinforce our shared vision and the strong culture we’re building together.”\n5. Leadership Insight: Vision for Growth\nThe significance of the New Delhi office extends beyond its physical presence. For the leadership team, it represents the tangible realization of entrepreneurial ambition and strategic foresight. The occasion was marked by a deep sense of pride and accomplishment.\nAs\nRajat Garg, VP – Tax Advisory\n, summed it up,\n“Seeing it all come together made it incredibly rewarding. The buzz of excitement and pride across the team—it truly felt like a defining moment for our journey ahead.”\n6. Conclusion: Toward an AI-Powered Financial Future\nThe expansion into New Delhi and the successful launch of the AI-Finance Roundtable reflects Occams Advisory’s broader vision of staying at the forefront of technological innovation. As we deepen our presence in India, we remain committed to shaping a more intelligent, inclusive, and future-ready financial landscape.\nSpeaking on this milestone,\nNitin Agarwal, CEO – India\n, remarked,\n“The highlight for me was watching Anupam’s raw entrepreneurial grit turn into a real, buzzing office.

To take advantage of the deduction, you'll need to fill out some paperwork. A tax specialist will guarantee that you carry out all of the necessary paperwork, so that you don't overpay taxes or incur penalties for not paying enough.\nInsurance premiums that help your company will be deducted.\nIn general, you can subtract insurance costs if they support the company and are used for business purposes. If you are a sole proprietor and wish to exclude health care rates, you can run into a snag. You would not be able to in some cases.\nThat is why we advise you to get the advice of a tax professional. They are aware of all the requirements that must be fulfilled before filing your taxes. Miscalculated deductions are a common audit red flag, which is why it's important to get it right the first time.\nYou will use the following worksheets to help you measure deductions:\nIRS Form 1040\nIRS Publication 535\nWhy premiums are eligible for a deduction?\nYou should exclude the ordinary and required cost of insurance as a business expense, according to the IRS Business Expenses guide. This may include the following:\nInsurance and general liabilities.\nWhen your company is charged over third-party physical injury on your premises, property damage your business causes, or promotional injuries, this provision protects court costs.\nLiability protection for professionals.\nThis scheme, also known as mistakes and omissions insurance or malpractice insurance, protects the company from claims alleging professional negligence.\nLand insurance for businesses.\nThis reimburses you for the expense of restoring or rebuilding your company property that has been destroyed or lost (e.g., real estate, equipment, inventory, etc.).\nInsurance on business loss.\nThis is also included with your property insurance coverage and includes your missed income if your company is forced to close due to an insured incident such as arson, windstorms, or other natural disaster.\nInsurance against cyber-attacks is available.\nWhen you're liable for someone else's data theft, third-party\ncyber liability insurance\ncovers your legal costs. When the company is hacked, first-party cyber responsibility will help offset the costs of responding.\nInsurance and workers' compensation.\nIn certain states, employers are expected to carry a certain level of workers' compensation insurance. After an occupational accident or sickness, it covers the employers' care costs and missed salaries.\nInsurance on commercial vehicles.\nThis proposal protects liabilities and property loss in the event of a collision involving a company car. It's important to note that you must pick between this deduction and the mileage deduction. It's impossible to get both.\nUnemployment compensation.\nThe money you owe to a state fund is normally deductible.\nHealth and life insurance are two types of insurance.\nIf the premiums are for employers, they will be deducted.\nCertain rates are not deductible.\nYou can't normally exclude the following forms of insurance premiums:\n* What you put into a self-insured reserve (some large companies have these accounts instead of carrying workers' compensation insurance)\n* Premiums with a\ndisability insurance package\nthat pays out if you lose a job.\n*\nLoan protection tax\npremiums\nOf course, little is set in stone when it comes to taxation. If you have any concerns, make sure to discuss them with your tax attorney.\n#BusinessInsurance #PremiumsDeduction #WorkersCompensation #UnemploymentInsurance #TaxDeduction\nArticle Credits –\ninsureon.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nLead Generation: The Lifeblood of B2B Success in Financial a...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction Fueling the Sales Pipeline: From Chaos to Consistency Building Brand Awareness: Visibility Breeds Trust   Identifying Ideal Customers: Precision Over...\nRead More\nHow Occams Advisory Helped Shannon Claim the Self-Employed T...\nBlog At A Glance: Introduction The Challenge Occams Advisory's Solution The Approach The Result Conclusion  Introduction In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many self-employed in...\nRead More\n10 Ways to Keep Your Clients Happy\nAccording to Forest Research, finding a new client costs five times as much as keeping an existing customer.

Per FT, ‘This ranking offers a snapshot of the relative strength of companies as they entered COVID19 pandemic and points to those likely to have the resilience to emerge from the crisis in good health.’ The FT Americas’ Fastest Growing Companies 2020 is a list of the 500 companies in the Americas that have the highest growth in publicly disclosed revenues between 2016 & 2019. The ranking was created through a complex procedure and compiled with Statista, a research company, and ranks entrants from across the Americas by compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue between 2016 and 2019.\n“Having been an Inc. 5000 honoree for 5 years (2016-2020), we at Occams are extremely grateful and proud to be on this highly coveted list. We are also thoughtful on the state of the world. Yet, we are committed to providing our clients the highest quality of our attention that got us these honors in the first place.” Occams’ Founder & CEO Anupam Satyasheel said. He further commented, “Our human capital is by far our most important asset. To empower our employees, we have put several measures in place which include a minimum hourly wage of $15, work from home options and quality healthcare. We are deeply committed to our community and have invested thousands of dollars on education and welfare of children worldwide.”\nOccams Advisory was founded in 2012 to serve as a one-stop firm that serves SMB’s worldwide. It provides expert services across four well-defined service-verticals: Growth Incubation, Investment Banking, Payment Innovations, and Advisory & Taxation. Occams is currently exploring multiple bolt-on acquisitions to turbocharge its rapid growth and anticipates going public by 2025.\nFind the full list of Financial Times -\nThe Americas’ fastest-growing companies 2021\nMedia Contact:\nDeborah Bingley | 714-747-2678\ndeborah.bingley@occamsadvisory.com\nRelated Topic Blog\nJuly 4th, 2022: Founder’s Note\nNoted American writer and civil rights activist Maya Angelou had said “equal rights, fair play, justice, are all like the air: We all have it, or none of us has it.” I add - equali...\nRead More\nAnupam Satyasheel recognized as Top 10 influential Business...\nProud to announce that Anupam Satyasheel, Founder and CEO of Occams Advisory, is among Medium's Top 10 Influential Business Leaders of 2024!

As United States and its 330+ million people gear up to celebrate our 246th Independence Day, we at Occams – regardless of whether we are in US or any other place – must remember the core principles that the most powerful nation in the world is built on: equality, rights, liberty, opportunity, and democracy. While some of the rights are being challenged through unexpected and unfair action by judiciary and the foundation of liberty were jeopardized by actions of those wo were entrusted to preserve it, we must cherish “Satyameva Jayate” (Truth only Triumphs), India’s national motto and an eternal refrain from Upanishad.\n2022 marks a watershed year in the history of Occams, not only because the company turned a decade old this year, but because we have found a new gear to our drive as we get past our COVID era lows.  As we celebrate Independence Day, let us remember that just like independence is not an entitlement and it must be preserved and nurtured each day, our growth is not an entitlement, and it must be earned by the actions of each employee each day. When you step up and serve a client in an exceptional way, we grow.  When you do your best with and for a team member, we grow. When you remember and rekindle your ambition each day, we grow.\nToday as we get ready for a special day that marks the upward surge of mankind towards cherished values such as liberty and opportunity, I invite you to let yourself free, free from the shackles of what is restraining you. I invite you to secure your genuine freedom: by setting a goal, a big goal, an audacious goal. It could be anything – professional, financial, relational, social, or spiritual. But it must be something that inspires and excites you. Spell out that inspires you, say what motivates you and scribble down which uplifts you towards what makes you. We at Occams must be committed to becoming better by making others better off. That means we give our clients a better service, we give our cohorts a better experience and most important we give ourselves a better future by creating a better today - through thoughtful and deliberate actions.\nLet us Incept the Infinite within us. Let us become truly Free.

In April 2021, Occams Advisory was featured on the 2nd annual\nFinancial Times\n’ Americas’ fastest-growing companies list.\n“Through the pandemic, Occams has stayed true to its employee-centric philosophy. It is exciting to return to a purpose-driven ecosystem which has evolved to become a leader in payment solutions and personal finance.” While lauding Occams, Ramki went on to emphasize upon a belief that emanates from his recent role as the CEO at\nCHC Wellbeing\n, a premier corporate wellness company, “Financial health is central to overall wellbeing, and this is an area where Occams’ offerings empower consumers.”\nWhile concurring on the value-add by Occams’ Personal Finance services, Divisional CEO\nDavid King\n, identified the rapidly evolving socio-economic and geo-political backdrop as the most challenging that he has seen. “What makes our committed presence in consumer finance space more relevant is that America is evolving faster than the world to maintain its position as the leader of the free world. The demands imposed by American consumers are that much higher in this era of 24x7 social media and global inter-connectedness.”\nThe seasoned leadership team at Occams will get a boost from Ramki’s return. Group COO,\nAugusto Ruiz-Eldridge\nconcurs, “Occams Group has continued to evolve and innovate to retain its go-to provider image for most middle-market professional services. In the months ahead we intend to pursue the growth through selective acquisitions that further our growth vision.”\nRelated Topic Blog\nOccams Advisory recognized as INC Power Partner 2024\nThe article highlights the winners of the Inc.

Industry leading names such as Tesla, Netflix, Uber and PayPal also featured on that list.\n“To sustain a growth trajectory that earns us a place among the fastest growing 5000 companies in the largest economy in the world for 5 successive years is a tribute to the dedication of our employees and the loyalty of our clients.” said Anupam Satyasheel, Founder & CEO of Occams Advisory.\nDavid King, the CEO of Occams’ Personal Finance division commented, “Being a part of an organization that strikes the elusive balance between maximizing client satisfaction and enhancing employee welfare, is a matter of honor and privilege.”\n“Having been Occams’ client across 2 different service areas, and now as the Group’s COO, I have been privileged to experience many dimensions of the Occams Way.” Chimed in Augusto Ruiz-Eldredge, who also leads EquiPay, Occams’ Fintech vertical.\nInc. 5000 list is the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies.

The 2020 Inc. 5000 achieved an incredible three-year average growth of over 500 percent, and a median rate of 165 percent.

Due to the increasing reliance on digital Infrastructure, ClOs face the daunting intricacies of striking the right balance between protection and progress of privacy and data governance. That’s precisely where a holistic governance risk and compliance framework comes into picture. Adopting the right GRC services enables organizations to reinvent their growth strategies, develop a more economical cost structure, and increase overall business efficiency.\nAs business ecosystems have become so deeply interconnected, a single error can result in widespread disruption. For this very reason organizations, today prefer an integrated approach to GRC. It helps organizations anticipate, understand, and holistically manage the risks while helping them connect the dots between risks, compliance, and other GRC elements that impact business performance. As a result, organizations can better balance risks and opportunities, make confident strategic decisions, and respond effectively to the changes that occur within and outside the enterprise. Also, an integrated GRC approach enables a coordinated and cross-organizational approach to risk management. Subsequently, GRC initiatives are aligned centrally with corporate governance and reporting but are distributed to lines of business to assign ownership, execution, and accountability.\nTechnology proves to be an essential key in delivering sustainability, consistency, efficiency, and transparency across this federated GRC process. Businesses are collecting and processing more data than ever, from various sources, and they’re sharing it more widely with partners, customers, and suppliers. With all this data moving around, internally, externally, and in the cloud, it’s clear that governance, risk, and compliance are at an inflection point. Artificial intelligence and machine learning allows enterprises to analyze data at scale, and spot patterns and anomalies that could indicate signs of trouble.\nAlthough organizations are witnessing a tremendous success leveraging GRC services, they face a great challenge when it comes to choosing the right service provider. To help them choose the best service providers, our distinguished panel of judges comprising CEOs, ClOs, and CMOs have analyzed scores of GRC service providers in the market and shortlisted the companies that are at the forefront of tackling challenges in the arena.\nWe present to you CFO Tech Outlook’s “\nTop 10 Risk and Compliance Consulting/Services Companies – 2019.\n”\nRelated Topic Blog\nOccams Advisory Achieves 9th Inc. 5000 Honor, Ranks No. 798...\nOccams Advisory earns its 9th Inc. 5000 recognition, ranking No. 798 in 2025 for sustained growth and excellence\nRead More\n4 Challenges of Hyper-Growth w/ Anupam Satyasheel\nB2B Growth is a daily podcast dedicated to helping B2B marketing leaders achieve explosive growth.

Since its founding, the company has added nine offices in three countries, and 92 people have joined the team.  Its combination of ability, expertise and client-driven growth has made a mark in the lower middle market financial advisory industry. “Almost five years ago, from the living room of a condo in Jersey City, Occam’s Paradigm started its journey to help small businesses grow and scale,” commented Founder and CEO Anupam Satyasheel. “While growing, we have also evolved as a company. We’ve diversified with the objective of being a one-stop shop to meet all advisory needs of our clients. This growth and diversification has led to the need for a more inclusive name that better represents the wide array of services and solutions we offer while staying true to our core operating philosophy.” Satyasheel continued, “Based on the feedback of our customers, employees and advisers, we have retained ‘Occams’ as that continues to reflect our underlying approach to problem solving by guiding our clients from complexity to simplicity.  We are excited about the road ahead and the many opportunities to serve our clients and to grow with their business as their trusted advisor. We have come some distance from our humble beginnings, but we have miles to go. We are grateful for our clients’ support along the way and are looking forward to more of it.” The company’s momentum is a testament to how it has helped its clients reach new levels of global growth. Client Lalit Rana, Director at NTS Computers Technology, stated: “When it comes to entering the US market there are many considerations and apprehensions, but Occam’s and Anupam help you make it happen smoothly. They have enabled NTS, coached the team and gave us world class support. It has allowed us to grow by over 400% each year for the last four years.”\nAbout Occams Advisory\nOccams Advisory is a global, full service small and middle market advisory firm.

To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2019. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2022. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2019 is $100,000; the minimum for 2022 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places.\nAbout Inc.\nInc. Business Media is the leading multimedia brand for entrepreneurs. Through its journalism, Inc. aims to inform, educate, and elevate the profile of our community: the risk-takers, the innovators, and the ultra-driven go-getters who are creating our future. Inc.’s award-winning work reaches more than 50 million people across a variety of channels, including events, print, digital, video, podcasts, newsletters, and social media.

For more information, visit\nwww.inc.com\n.\nFor more information on the Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, slated for October 31-November 2 in San Antonio, visit\nhttp://conference.inc.com/\n.\nSarasota, FL,\nAugust 23, 2023 – Inc. revealed that Occams Advisory, a leader in professional and business services, got featured on the 2023 Inc. 5000, its annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Facebook, Chobani, Under Armor, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other household names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000. Occams Advisory is a professional advisory firm bringing Fortune 500 expertise to medium and small businesses, helping clients advance through their business life cycle. This is 7th time in 8 years that Occams Advisory has made it to the Inc 5000 list, putting it in an elite league of less than 1,000 companies.\n“We value our growth which we owe to the trust there are clients and our employees place in us. Our accountability to our communities, climate and country is a huge responsibility that we take very seriously. Recognitions like this make us more committed to keep pushing towards our eventual goal of becoming a Fortune 500 company.” Through these words Anupam Satyasheel, Founder & CEO, reiterated Occams’ commitment to a regenerative economy. Under Anupam’s leadership Occams has grown over 175 times in 10 years and had its best year ever in 2022 while diversifying into new business lines and expanding to Canada and Latin America. Anupam also shared that Occams’ 2023 YTD revenue has already exceeded FY 2022’s and he expects Occams to make it to the 2024 Inc 5000 list as well.\nThe Inc. 5000 class of 2023 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 500 companies, the average median 3-year revenue growth rate ticked up to an astonishing 2,238 percent. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 1,187,266 jobs to the economy over the past 3 years.\n“Running a business has only gotten harder since the end of the pandemic,” said Inc. editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk. “To make the Inc. 5000—with the fast growth that requires—is truly an accomplishment. Inc. is thrilled to honor the companies that are building our future.”\nRelated Topic Blog\nTop 8 Indian American Companies in US Chamber of Commerce CO...\nThe article lists the top 8 Indian-American companies featured in the US Chamber of Commerce's CO—100, highlighting their contributions to innovation and global business leadership...\nRead More\nOccams Advisory Achieves 9th Inc. 5000 Honor, Ranks No. 798...\nOccams Advisory earns its 9th Inc. 5000 recognition, ranking No. 798 in 2025 for sustained growth and excellence\nRead More\nOccams Advisory Awarded on the Fortune’s America’s Most Inno...\nMarch 29th, 2023: <strong>Occams Advisory</strong> has been awarded on the <strong>Fortune list of America’s Most Innovative Companies 2023</strong>.
